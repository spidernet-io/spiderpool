| A00001  | It fails to run a pod with different VLANs for IPv4 and IPv6 IPPools | p3       |       | done   |       |
| A00002  | Added fields such as `"dist":"1.0.0.0/16"`, `"gw":"1.0.0.1"`, and `nics` and the pod was running successfully                              | p2       |       | done   |       |
| A00003  | Failed to run a pod with invalid annotations                         | p3       |       | done   |       |
| A00004  | Take a test with the Priority: pod annotation > namespace annotation > specified in a CNI profile > settings in ConfigMap                     | p1       |       | done   |       |
| A00005  | The "IPPools" annotation has the higher Priority over the "IPPool" annotation | p1       |       | done   |         |
| A00006  | The namespace annotation has precedence over global default IPPool   | p1       | true  | done   |       |
| A00007  | Spiderpool will successively try to allocate IPs in the order of the elements in the IPPool array until the first allocation succeeds or all fail | p1       | true  | done   |       |
| A00008  | Successfully run an annotated multi-container pod                    | p2       |       | done   |       |
| A00009  | Modify the annotated IPPool for a specified Deployment pod<br />Modify the annotated IPPool for a specified StatefulSet pod                 | p2       |       |  done   |       |
| A00010  | Modify the annotated IPPool for a pod running on multiple NICs       | p3       |       | done   |       |
| A00011  | Use the ippool route with `cleanGateway=false` in the pod annotation as a default route | p3     |     |  done  |         |
| A00012  | Specify the default NIC through Pod annotations  | p2     |     |    |         |

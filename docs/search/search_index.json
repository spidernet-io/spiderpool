Currently, it is under developing stage, not ready for production environment yet. Any Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin supporting third-party IPAM plugins can use the Spiderpool, such as MacVLAN CNI , VLAN CNI , IPVLAN CNI etc. The Spiderpool also supports Multus CNI case to assign IP for multiple interfaces. More CNIs will be tested for integration with Spiderpool. Why Spiderpool Most overlay CNIs, like Cilium and Calico , have a good implementation of IPAM, so the Spiderpool is not intentionally designed for these cases, but may be integrated with them. The Spiderpool is specifically designed to use with underlay network, where administrators can accurately manage each IP. Currently, the community already has some IPAM plugins such as whereabout , kube-ipam , static , dhcp , and host-local , but few of them could help solve complex underlay-network issues, so we decide to develop the Spiderpool. BTW, there are also some CNI plugins that could work in the underlay mode, such as kube-ovn and coil . But the Spiderpool provides lots of different features. See Features for details. Features The Spiderpool provides a large number of different features as follows. Based on CRD storage, all operation could be done with kubernetes API-server. Support for assigning IP addresses with three options: IPv4-only, IPv6-only, and dual-stack. Support for working on the clusters with three options: IPv4-only, IPv6-only, and dual-stack. Support for creating multiple ippools. Different namespaces and applications could monopolize or share an ippool. An application could specify multiple backup ippool resources in case IP addresses in an ippool are out of use. Therefore, you neither need to scale up the IP resources in a fixed ippool, nor need to modify the application yaml to change an ippool. Support to bind a range of IP addresses to a single application. No need to hard code an IP list in a deployment yaml, which is not easy to modify. With Spiderpool, you only need to set the selector field of ippool and scale up or down the IP resource of an ippool dynamically. Support for always assigning the same IP address to a StatefulSet pod. Different pods in a single controller could get IP addresses from different subnets for an application deployed in different subnets or zones. Administrator could safely edit ippool resources, where the Spiderpool will help validate the modification and prevent from data race. Collect resources in real time, especially for solving IP leakage or slow collection, which may make new pod fail to assign IP addresses. Support ranges of CNI plugin that supports third-party IPAM plugins. Especially, the Spiderpool could help much for CNI like spiderflat , macvlan CNI , vlan CNI , ipvlan CNI , sriov CNI , ovs CNI . Especially support for Multus CNI case to assign IP for multiple interfaces. Have a good performance for assigning and collecting IP. Support to reserve IP that will not be assigned to any pod. Included metrics for looking into IP usage and issues. By CIDR Manager, it could automatically scale up and down the IP address of the ippool, to distribute IP resource more reasonable between ippool. Support for both ARM64 and ARM64.

Generic Set up the Helm repository. helm repo add spiderpool https://spidernet-io.github.io/spiderpool Deploy Spiderpool using the default configuration options via Helm: helm install spiderpool spiderpool/spiderpool --namespace kube-system More details about Spiderpool charts parameters . It should be noted that the Pods of the spiderpool-controller have to run in the hostnetwork mode, because there may be no other IPAM CNI in the Kubernetes cluster that can allocate some IP addresses to them. In this regard, we used podAntiAffinity to ensure that different replicas of spiderpool-controller will not run on the same Node to avoid host port conflicts. The replicas of spiderpool-controller can be adjusted by setting parameter spiderpoolController.replicas , but please ensure that you have enough Nodes to run them. IP version Spiderpool can work in IPv4 only, IPv6 only or dual-stack case. For example, you can deploy Spiderpool in this way to enable dual stack: helm install spiderpool spiderpool/spiderpool --namespace kube-system \\ --set feature.enableIPv4=true \\ --set feature.enableIPv6=true By default, feature.enableIPv4 is enabled and feature.enableIPv6 is not. Certificates Spiderpool-controller needs TLS certificates to run webhook server. You can configure it in several ways. Auto Use Helm's template function genSignedCert to generate TLS certificates. This is the simplest and most common way to configure: helm install spiderpool spiderpool/spiderpool --namespace kube-system \\ --set spiderpoolController.tls.method=auto Note that the default value of parameter spiderpoolController.tls.method is auto . Provided If you want to run spiderpool-controller with a self-signed certificate, provided would be a good choice. You can use OpenSSL to generate certificates, or run the following script: wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spidernet-io/spiderpool/main/tools/cert/generateCert.sh Generate the certificates: chmod +x generateCert.sh && ./generateCert.sh \"/tmp/tls\" CA=`cat /tmp/tls/ca.crt | base64 -w0 | tr -d '\\n'` SERVER_CERT=`cat /tmp/tls/server.crt | base64 -w0 | tr -d '\\n'` SERVER_KEY=`cat /tmp/tls/server.key | base64 -w0 | tr -d '\\n'` Then, deploy Spiderpool in the provided mode: helm install spiderpool spiderpool/spiderpool --namespace kube-system \\ --set spiderpoolController.tls.method=provided \\ --set spiderpoolController.tls.provided.tlsCa=${CA} \\ --set spiderpoolController.tls.provided.tlsCert=${SERVER_CERT} \\ --set spiderpoolController.tls.provided.tlsKey=${SERVER_KEY} Cert-manager It is not recommended to use this mode directly , because the Spiderpool requires the TLS certificates provided by cert-manager, while the cert-manager requires the IP address provided by Spiderpool (cycle reference). Therefore, if possible, you must first deploy cert-manager using other IPAM CNI in the Kubernetes cluster, and then deploy Spiderpool. helm install spiderpool spiderpool/spiderpool --namespace kube-system \\ --set spiderpoolController.tls.method=certmanager \\ --set spiderpoolController.tls.certmanager.issuerName=${CERT_MANAGER_ISSUER_NAME} Cluster default IPPool The cluster default IPPool usually serves some components that need IP addresses when the Kubernetes cluster is initialized, such as CoreDNS. Prepare the IP address ranges you need to use next: # \"CIDR\" IPV4_SUBNET_YOU_EXPECT=\"172.18.40.0/24\" # \"IP\" or \"IP-IP\" IPV4_IPRANGES_YOU_EXPECT=\"172.18.40.40-172.20.40.200\" Let's create an IPv4 IPPool while deploying Spiderpool, and configure it as the cluster default IPPool in the global Configmap configuration . helm install spiderpool spiderpool/spiderpool --namespace kube-system \\ --set feature.enableIPv4=true \\ --set clusterDefaultPool.installIPv4IPPool=true \\ --set clusterDefaultPool.ipv4Subnet=${IPV4_SUBNET_YOU_EXPECT} \\ --set clusterDefaultPool.ipv4IPRanges={${IPV4_IPRANGES_YOU_EXPECT}} IPv6 IPPool is similar: helm install spiderpool spiderpool/spiderpool --namespace kube-system \\ --set feature.enableIPv6=true \\ --set clusterDefaultPool.installIPv6IPPool=true \\ --set clusterDefaultPool.ipv6Subnet=${IPV6_SUBNET_YOU_EXPECT} \\ --set clusterDefaultPool.ipv6IPRanges={${IPV6_IPRANGES_YOU_EXPECT}} Full example Here is a general deployment example, which satisfies the following conditions: Dual stack. Generate TLS certificates in auto mode. Create and configure the cluster default IPv4/6 IPPool. helm install spiderpool spiderpool/spiderpool --namespace kube-system \\ --set spiderpoolController.tls.method=auto \\ --set feature.enableIPv4=true \\ --set feature.enableIPv6=true \\ --set clusterDefaultPool.installIPv4IPPool=true \\ --set clusterDefaultPool.installIPv6IPPool=true \\ --set clusterDefaultPool.ipv4Subnet=${IPV4_SUBNET_YOU_EXPECT} \\ --set clusterDefaultPool.ipv4IPRanges={${IPV4_IPRANGES_YOU_EXPECT}} \\ --set clusterDefaultPool.ipv6Subnet=${IPV6_SUBNET_YOU_EXPECT} \\ --set clusterDefaultPool.ipv6IPRanges={${IPV6_IPRANGES_YOU_EXPECT}} Update CNI network configuration Finally, you should edit the CNI network configuration with the default path /etc/cni/net.d on the related Nodes so that the Main CNI can use Spiderpool IPAM CNI to allocate IP addresses. Replace the ipam object with the following: \"ipam\":{ \"type\":\"spiderpool\" } The following is an example for macvlan CNI : { \"cniVersion\":\"0.4.0\", \"type\":\"macvlan\", \"mode\":\"bridge\", \"master\":\"eth0\", \"name\":\"macvlan\", \"ipam\":{ \"type\":\"spiderpool\" } } Uninstall Generally, you can uninstall Spiderpool release in this way: helm uninstall spiderpool -n kube-system However, there are finalizers in some CRs of Spiderpool, the helm uninstall cmd may not clean up all relevant CRs. Get this cleanup script and execute it to ensure that unexpected errors will not occur when deploying Spiderpool next time. wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spidernet-io/spiderpool/main/tools/scripts/cleanCRD.sh chmod +x cleanCRD.sh && ./cleanCRD.sh","title":"Installation"},{"location":"usage/install/#installation","text":"This guide shows how to install Spiderpool using Helm .","title":"Installation"},{"location":"usage/install/#generic","text":"Set up the Helm repository. helm repo add spiderpool https://spidernet-io.github.io/spiderpool Deploy Spiderpool using the default configuration options via Helm: helm install spiderpool spiderpool/spiderpool --namespace kube-system More details about Spiderpool charts parameters .

Prepare a Deployment whose Pods have the label (or labels) matching the affinity. Usually, you should select the value of the field matchLabels as this label (or labels). Specify pool selection rules through the annotation ipam.spidernet.io/ippool or ipam.spidernet.io/ippools (multi-NIC) in Pod template. You can learn more about their differences here . Apply the manifest of this Deployment. An interesting question is, with the scale up of a Deployment, what happens when the IP addresses in the IPPool are insufficient? The result is that some Pods will not work because they cannot be assigned with some IP addresses and you have to manually expand the IPPool to solve this problem. However, if you enable the feature SpiderSubnet of Spiderpool, the IPPool will not only be automatically created with the creation of the Deployment (or other workloads), but also automatically scale up/down with the change of replicas .

Specify pool selection rules through the annotation ipam.spidernet.io/ippool or ipam.spidernet.io/ippools (multi-NIC) in Pod template. You can learn more about their differences here . Apply the manifest of this Deployment. An interesting question is, with the scale up of a Deployment, what happens when the IP addresses in the IPPool are insufficient? The result is that some Pods will not work because they cannot be assigned with some IP addresses and you have to manually expand the IPPool to solve this problem. However, if you enable the feature SpiderSubnet of Spiderpool, the IPPool will not only be automatically created with the creation of the Deployment (or other workloads), but also automatically scale up/down with the change of replicas .

If you specify both of them two, it only uses ipam.spidernet.io/subnets mode. For annotation ipam.spidernet.io/ippool-ip-number , you can use '2' for fixed IP number or '+2' for flexible mode. The value '+2' means the SpiderSubnet auto-created IPPool will add 2 more IPs based on your application replicas. If you choose to use flexible mode, the auto-created IPPool IPs will expand or shrink dynamically by your application replicas. The current version only supports to use one SpiderSubnet V4/V6 CR, you shouldn't specify 2 or more SpiderSubnet V4 CRs and the spiderpool-controller will choose the first one to use.

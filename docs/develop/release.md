## push a version tag

If a tag vx.x.x is pushed , the following steps will automatically run:

1. check the tag name is same with <https://github.com/spidernet-io/spiderpool/blob/main/VERSION>

2. create a branch named 'release-vx.x.x'

3. build the images with the pushed tag, and push to ghcr registry <https://github.com/orgs/spidernet-io/packages?repo_name=spiderpool>

4. generate the changelog by historical PR labeled as "pr/release/*"

    submit the changelog file to directory 'changelogs' of branch 'github_pages', with PR labeled as "pr/release/robot_update_githubpage".

    changelogs is generated by historical PR label:

    label "pr/release/feature-new" to be classified to "New Features"

    label "pr/release/feature-changed" to be classified to "Changed Features"

    label "pr/release/feature-bug" to be classified to "Fixes"

5. build the chart package with the pushed tag, and submit a PR to branch 'github_pages' 

    you cloud get the chart with command `helm repo add spiderpool https://spidernet-io.github.io/spiderpool`

6. submit '/docs' to '/docs' of branch 'github_pages'

7. create a GitHub Release attached with the chart package and changelog

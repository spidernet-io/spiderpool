# Metrics

Spiderpool can be configured to serve [Opentelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) metrics.
Spiderpool metrics provide the insight of Spiderpool Agent and Spiderpool Controller.

## Get Started

### Enable Metric support

Firstly, please ensure you have installed the spiderpool and configured the CNI file, refer [install](./install.md) for details

Check the environment variable `SPIDERPOOL_ENABLED_METRIC` of the daemonset `spiderpool-agent` for whether it is already set to `true` or not.

Check the environment variable `SPIDERPOOL_ENABLED_METRIC` of deployment `spiderpool-controller` for whether it is already set to `true` or not.

```shell
kubectl -n kube-system get daemonset spiderpool-agent -o yaml
------
kubectl -n kube-system get deployment spiderpool-controller -o yaml
```

You can set one or both of them to `true`.
For example, let's enable spiderpool agent metrics by running `helm upgrade --set spiderpoolAgent.prometheus.enabled=true`.

## Metric reference

### Spiderpool Agent

Spiderpool agent exports some metrics related with IPAM allocation and deallocation. Currently, those include:


| Name                                         | description                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ipam_allocation_total_counts                 | Count of the number of the IPAM allocation requests that Spiderpool Agent received , prometheus type: counter |
| ipam_allocation_failure_counts               | Number of Spiderpool Agent IPAM allocation failures, prometheus type: counter |
| ipam_allocation_rollback_failure_counts      | Number of Spiderpool Agent IPAM allocation rollback failure, prometheus type: counter |
| ipam_allocation_err_internal_counts          | Number of Spiderpool Agent IPAM allocation internal error, prometheus type: counter |
| ipam_allocation_err_no_available_pool_counts | Number of Spiderpool Agent IPAM allocation no available IPPool error, prometheus type: counter |
| ipam_allocation_err_retries_exhausted_counts | Number of Spiderpool Agent IPAM allocation retries exhausted error, prometheus type: counter |
| ipam_allocation_err_ip_used_out_counts       | Number of Spiderpool Agent IPAM allocation IP addresses used out error, prometheus type: counter |
| ipam_allocation_average_duration_seconds     | The average duration of all Spiderpool Agent allocation processes, prometheus type: gauge |
| ipam_allocation_max_duration_seconds         | The maximum duration of Spiderpool Agent allocation process (per-process), prometheus type: gauge |
| ipam_allocation_min_duration_seconds         | The minimum duration of Spiderpool Agent allocation process (per-process), prometheus type: gauge |
| ipam_allocation_latest_duration_seconds      | The latest duration of Spiderpool Agent allocation process (per-process), prometheus type: gauge |
| ipam_allocation_duration_seconds             | Per Spiderpool Agent allocation process, it can be showed IPAM allocation duration distribution, prometheus type: histogram |
| ipam_deallocation_total_counts               | Count of the number of Spiderpool Agent received the IPAM deallocation requests, prometheus type: counter |
| ipam_deallocation_failure_counts             | Number of Spiderpool Agent IPAM deallocation failure, prometheus type: counter |
| ipam_releasing_err_internal_counts           | Number of Spiderpool Agent IPAM releasing internal error, prometheus type: counter |
| ipam_releasing_err_retries_exhausted_counts  | Number of Spiderpool Agent IPAM releasing retries exhausted error, prometheus type: counter |
| ipam_deallocation_average_duration_seconds   | The average duration of all Spiderpool Agent deallocation processes, prometheus type: gauge |
| ipam_deallocation_max_duration_seconds       | The maximum duration of Spiderpool Agent deallocation process (per-process), prometheus type: gauge |
| ipam_deallocation_min_duration_seconds       | The minimum duration of Spiderpool Agent deallocation process (per-process), prometheus type: gauge |
| ipam_deallocation_latest_duration_seconds    | The latest duration of Spiderpool Agent deallocation process (per-process), prometheus type: gauge |
| ipam_deallocation_duration_seconds           | Per Spiderpool Agent deallocation process, it can be showed IPAM deallocation duration distribution, prometheus type: histogram |

### Spiderpool Controller

Spiderpool controller exports some metrics related with SpiderIPPool IP garbage collection. Currently, those include:

| Name                 | description                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ip_gc_total_counts   | Number of Spiderpool Controller IP garbage collection, prometheus type: counter |
| ip_gc_failure_counts | Number of Spiderpool Controller IP garbage collection failures, prometheus type: counter |

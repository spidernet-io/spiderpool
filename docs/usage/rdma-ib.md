# RDMA with Infiniband

**English** ｜ [**简体中文**](./rdma-ib-zh_CN.md)

## Introduction

This chapter introduces how POD access network with the infiniband interface of the host. 

## Features

Different from RoCE, Infiniband network cards are proprietary devices for the Infiniband network, and the Spiderpool offers two CNI options:

1. [IB-SRIOV CNI](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/ib-sriov-cni) provides SR-IOV network card with the RDMA device. It is suitable for workloads requiring RDMA communication.

    It offers two RDMA modes:

    - Shared mode: Pod will have a SR-IOV network interface with RDMA feature, but all RDMA devices cloud be seen by all PODs running in the same node. POD may be confused for which RDMA device it should use. 

    - Exclusive mode: Pod will have a SR-IOV network interface with RDMA feature, and POD just enable to see its own RDMA device. 

        For isolated RDMA network cards, at least one of the following conditions must be met:

        (1) Kernel based on 5.3.0 or newer, RDMA modules loaded in the system. rdma-core package provides means to automatically load relevant modules on system start
   
        (2) Mellanox OFED version 4.7 or newer is required. In this case it is not required to use a Kernel based on 5.3.0 or newer.

2. [IPoIB CNI](https://github.com/mellanox/ipoib-cni) provides an IPoIB network card for POD, without RDMA device. It is suitable for conventional applications that require TCP/IP communication, as it does not require an SRIOV network card, allowing more PODs to run on the host

## RDMA based on IB-SRIOV

The following steps demonstrate how to use [IB-SRIOV](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/ib-sriov-cni) on a cluster with 2 nodes. It enables POD to own SR-IOV network card and the RDMA devices of isolated network namespace

1. Ensure that the host machine has an Infiniband card installed and the driver is properly installed.

    In our demo environment, the host machine is equipped with a Mellanox ConnectX-5 VPI NIC.

    Follow [the official NVIDIA guide](https://developer.nvidia.com/networking/ethernet-software) to install the latest OFED driver. 

    For Mellanox's VPI series network cards, you can refer to the official [Switching Infiniband Mode](https://support.mellanox.com/s/article/mlnx2-117-1997kn) to ensure that the network card is working in Infiniband mode.

    To confirm the presence of Inifiniband devices, use the following command:

        ~# lspci -nn | grep Infiniband
        86:00.0 Infiniband controller [0207]: Mellanox Technologies MT27800 Family [ConnectX-5] [15b3:1017]

        ~# rdma link
        link mlx5_0/1 subnet_prefix fe80:0000:0000:0000 lid 2 sm_lid 2 lmc 0 state ACTIVE physical_state LINK_UP

        ~# ibstat mlx5_0 | grep "Link layer"
        Link layer: InfiniBand

    Make sure that the RDMA subsystem of the host is in exclusive mode. If not, switch to shared mode.

        ~# rdma system set netns exclusive
        ~# echo "options ib_core netns_mode=0" >> /etc/modprobe.d/ib_core.conf
        ~# reboot

        ~# rdma system
        netns exclusive copy-on-fork on

    > if it is expected to work under shared mode, `rm /etc/modprobe.d/ib_core.conf && reboot`

    (Optional) In an SR-IOV scenario, applications can enable NVIDIA's GPUDirect RDMA feature. For instructions on installing the kernel module, please refer to [the official documentation](https://network.nvidia.com/products/GPUDirect-RDMA/).

2. Install Spiderpool, and notice the helm options:

        helm upgrade spiderpool spiderpool/spiderpool --namespace kube-system  --reuse-values --set sriov.install=true

    - If you are a user from China, you can specify the parameter `--set global.imageRegistryOverride=ghcr.m.daocloud.io` to pull image from China registry.
    
    Once the installation is complete, the following components will be installed:

        ~# kubectl get pod -n kube-system
        spiderpool-agent-9sllh                         1/1     Running     0          1m
        spiderpool-agent-h92bv                         1/1     Running     0          1m
        spiderpool-controller-7df784cdb7-bsfwv         1/1     Running     0          1m
        spiderpool-sriov-operator-65b59cd75d-89wtg     1/1     Running     0          1m
        spiderpool-init                                0/1     Completed   0          1m

3. configure SR-IOV operator.

    use the following commands to look up the device information of infiniband card

        ~# lspci -nn | grep Infiniband
        86:00.0 Infiniband controller [0207]: Mellanox Technologies MT27800 Family [ConnectX-5] [15b3:1017]

    apply the following yaml, then the VF resource will be created

        cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
        apiVersion: sriovnetwork.openshift.io/v1
        kind: SriovNetworkNodePolicy
        metadata:
          name: ib-sriov
          namespace: kube-system
        spec:
          nodeSelector:
            kubernetes.io/os: "linux"
          resourceName: mellanoxibsriov
          priority: 99
          numVfs: 12
          nicSelector:
              deviceID: "1017"
              rootDevices:
              - 0000:86:00.0
              vendor: "15b3"
          deviceType: netdevice
          isRdma: true
        EOF

    View the available resources on a node, including the reported RDMA device resources:

        ~# kubectl get no -o json | jq -r '[.items[] | {name:.metadata.name, allocable:.status.allocatable}]'
        [
          {
            "name": "10-20-1-10",
            "allocable": {
              "cpu": "40",
              "pods": "110",
              "spidernet.io/mellanoxibsriov": "12",
              ...
            }
          },
          ...
        ]  

4. Create the CNI configuration of IB-SRIOV, and the ippool resource

        cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
        apiVersion: spiderpool.spidernet.io/v2beta1
        kind: SpiderIPPool
        metadata:
          name: v4-91
        spec:
          gateway: 172.91.0.1
          ips:
            - 172.91.0.100-172.91.0.120
          subnet: 172.91.0.0/16
        ---
        apiVersion: spiderpool.spidernet.io/v2beta1
        kind: SpiderMultusConfig
        metadata:
          name: ib-sriov
          namespace: kube-system
        spec:
          cniType: ib-sriov
          ibsriov:
            resourceName: spidernet.io/mellanoxibsriov
            ippools:
              ipv4: ["v4-91"]
        EOF

5. Following the configurations from the previous step, create a DaemonSet application that spans across nodes for testing

        ANNOTATION_MULTUS="v1.multus-cni.io/default-network: kube-system/ib-sriov"
        RESOURCE="spidernet.io/mellanoxibsriov"
        NAME=ib-sriov
        cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
        apiVersion: apps/v1
        kind: DaemonSet
        metadata:
          name: ${NAME}
          labels:
            app: $NAME
        spec:
          selector:
            matchLabels:
              app: $NAME
          template:
            metadata:
              name: $NAME
              labels:
                app: $NAME
              annotations:
                ${ANNOTATION_MULTUS}
            spec:
              containers:
              - image: docker.io/mellanox/rping-test
                imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
                name: mofed-test
                securityContext:
                  capabilities:
                    add: [ "IPC_LOCK" ]
                resources:
                  limits:
                    ${RESOURCE}: 1
                command:
                - sh
                - -c
                - |
                  ls -l /dev/infiniband /sys/class/net
                  sleep 1000000
        EOF

6. Verify that RDMA data transmission is working correctly between the Pods across nodes.

    Open a terminal and access one Pod to launch a service:

        ~# rdma link
        link mlx5_4/1 subnet_prefix fe80:0000:0000:0000 lid 8 sm_lid 1 lmc 0 state ACTIVE physical_state LINK_UP
        
        # Start an RDMA service
        ~# ib_read_lat

    Open a terminal and access another Pod to launch a service:

        ~# rdma link
        link mlx5_8/1 subnet_prefix fe80:0000:0000:0000 lid 7 sm_lid 1 lmc 0 state ACTIVE physical_state LINK_UP
        
        # succeed to visit the service on the other POD
        ~# ib_read_lat 172.91.0.115

## IPoIB

The following steps demonstrate how to use [IPoIB](https://github.com/mellanox/ipoib-cni) on a cluster with 2 nodes, it enables Pod to own a regular TCP/IP network cards without RDMA device.

1. Ensure that the host machine has an Infiniband card installed and the driver is properly installed.

    In our demo environment, the host machine is equipped with a Mellanox ConnectX-5 VPI NIC.

    Follow [the official NVIDIA guide](https://developer.nvidia.com/networking/ethernet-software) to install the latest OFED driver.

    For Mellanox's VPI series network cards, you can refer to the official [Switching Infiniband Mode](https://support.mellanox.com/s/article/mlnx2-117-1997kn) to ensure that the network card is working in Infiniband mode.

    To confirm the presence of Inifiniband devices, use the following command:

        ~# lspci -nn | grep Infiniband
        86:00.0 Infiniband controller [0207]: Mellanox Technologies MT27800 Family [ConnectX-5] [15b3:1017]

        ~# rdma link
        link mlx5_0/1 subnet_prefix fe80:0000:0000:0000 lid 2 sm_lid 2 lmc 0 state ACTIVE physical_state LINK_UP

        ~# ibstat mlx5_0 | grep "Link layer"
        Link layer: InfiniBand

    Check the ipoib interface of the Inifiniband device

        ~# ip a show ibs5f0
        9: ibs5f0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 2044 qdisc mq state UP group default qlen 256
        link/infiniband 00:00:10:49:fe:80:00:00:00:00:00:00:e8:eb:d3:03:00:93:ae:10 brd 00:ff:ff:ff:ff:12:40:1b:ff:ff:00:00:00:00:00:00:ff:ff:ff:ff
        altname ibp134s0f0
        inet 172.91.0.10/16 brd 172.91.255.255 scope global ibs5f0
        valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
        inet6 fd00:91::172:91:0:10/64 scope global

        inet6 fe80::eaeb:d303:93:ae10/64 scope link
        valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

2. Install Spiderpool

    If you are a user from China, you can specify the parameter `--set global.imageRegistryOverride=ghcr.m.daocloud.io` to pull image from China registry.

    Once the installation is complete, the following components will be installed:

        ~# kubectl get pod -n kube-system
        spiderpool-agent-9sllh                         1/1     Running     0          1m
        spiderpool-agent-h92bv                         1/1     Running     0          1m
        spiderpool-controller-7df784cdb7-bsfwv         1/1     Running     0          1m
        spiderpool-init                                0/1     Completed   0          1m

3. Create the CNI configuration of ipoib, and the ippool. The `spec.ipoib.master` of SpiderMultusConfig should be set to the infiniband interface of the node.

        cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
        apiVersion: spiderpool.spidernet.io/v2beta1
        kind: SpiderIPPool
        metadata:
          name: v4-91
        spec:
          gateway: 172.91.0.1
          ips:
            - 172.91.0.100-172.91.0.120
          subnet: 172.91.0.0/16
        ---
        apiVersion: spiderpool.spidernet.io/v2beta1
        kind: SpiderMultusConfig
        metadata:
          name: ipoib
          namespace: kube-system
        spec:
          cniType: ib-sriov
          ipoib:
            master: "ibs5f0"
            ippools:
              ipv4: ["v4-91"]
        EOF

4. Following the configurations from the previous step, create a DaemonSet application that spans across nodes for testing

        ANNOTATION_MULTUS="v1.multus-cni.io/default-network: kube-system/ipoib"
        NAME=ipoib
        cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
        apiVersion: apps/v1
        kind: DaemonSet
        metadata:
          name: ${NAME}
          labels:
            app: $NAME
        spec:
          selector:
            matchLabels:
              app: $NAME
          template:
            metadata:
              name: $NAME
              labels:
                app: $NAME
              annotations:
                ${ANNOTATION_MULTUS}
            spec:
              containers:
              - image: docker.io/mellanox/rping-test
                imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
                name: mofed-test
                securityContext:
                  capabilities:
                    add: [ "IPC_LOCK" ]
                command:
                - sh
                - -c
                - |
                  ls -l /dev/infiniband /sys/class/net
                  sleep 1000000
        EOF

5. Verify that the network communication is correct between the PODs across nodes.

        ~# kubectl get pod -o wide

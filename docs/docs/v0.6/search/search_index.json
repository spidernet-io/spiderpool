Introduction Spiderpool is a Kubernetes underlay network solution. It provides rich IPAM features and CNI integration capabilities, powering CNI projects in the open source community, allowing multiple CNIs to collaborate effectively. It enables underlay CNI to run perfectly in environments such as bare metal, virtual machines, and any public cloud . Why developing Spiderpool? Currently, the open source community does not provide comprehensive, friendly, and intelligent underlay network solutions, so Spiderpool aims to provide many innovative features: Rich IPAM feature. Shared and dedicated IP pools, assigning fixed IP address, automatic operation of dedicated IP pools for creating, scaling, and reclaiming. It could match kinds of underlay network requirements. Underlay CNI and overlay CNI cooperation, multiple CNI interfaces for pod. Spiderpool helps assign IP address to multiple underlay interfaces, coordinate policy route between interfaces to ensure consistence data path of request and reply packets. Multiple CNIs cooperate to reduce hardware requirements for deploying the cluster. Enhance underlay CNI like Macvlan CNI , ipvlan CNI , SR-IOV CNI , ovs CNI to connect Pod and host to access clusterIP and check pod health, and to detect IP conflict and gateway accessibility. Not only limited to bare metal environments in data centers, but also providing a unified underlay CNI solution for openstack, vmware, and various public cloud scenarios. underlay CNI There are two technologies in cloud-native networking: \"overlay network\" and \"underlay network\". Despite no strict definition for underlay and overlay networks in cloud-native networking, we can simply abstract their characteristics from many CNI projects. The two technologies meet the needs of different scenarios. The article provides a brief comparison of IPAM and network performance between the two technologies, which offers better insights into the unique features and use cases of Spiderpool. Why underlay network solutions? The following requirements necessitate underlay network solutions: Network performance. Network performance advantages, like low latency, high throughput, low forwarding overhead of node\u2019s CPU. It fits to applications like financial and AI application. Transformation cost. The traditional host application has characteristic, like exposing service with host fixed IP, separating communication with different subnets. At the beginning of migrating to the kubernetes, the underlay network solution spend low transformation cost of netowrk, application can directly use Pod IP for cluster east-west and north-south communication. Network security. In the data center, it may be used to enforce network security to Pod, like firewall and isolating communication with VLAN. The underlay network solution could expose the Pod packet without tunnel encapsulation, and meet requirements. Bandwitdth. It can help Pod to customize the exit network interface of the node, thereby ensuring bandwidth isolation of the underlying subnet. It can help components such as kubevirt , storage, and logging, to transmit massive amounts of data. Multi clusters. For multi clusters, all Pods of multi clusters are connected to the underlay network, so they could communicate smoothly without the need to deploy additional components for cluster connectivity. Architecture Spiderpool consists of the following components: Spiderpool controller: deployment that manage CRD validation, status updates, IP recovery, and automated IP pools Spiderpool agent: daemonset that help Spiderpool plugins by performing IP allocation and coordinator plugin for information synchronization. IPAM plugin: a binary plugin on each host that CNI can utilize to implement IP allocation. coordinator plugin: a binary plugin on each host that CNI can use for multi-NIC route coordination, IP conflict detection, and host connectivity. ifacer plugin: A binary plugin on each host that helps CNIs such as macvlan and ipvlan dynamically create bond and vlan interfaces On top of its own components, Spiderpool relies on open-source underlay CNIs to allocate network interfaces to Pods. You can use Multus CNI to manage multiple NICs and CNI configurations. Any CNI project compatible with third-party IPAM plugins can work well with Spiderpool, such as: Macvlan CNI , vlan CNI , ipvlan CNI , SR-IOV CNI , ovs CNI , Multus CNI , Calico CNI , Weave CNI Use case: underlay CNIs access layer2 In underlay networks, Spiderpool can work with underlay CNIs such as Macvlan CNI , SR-IOV CNI , ipvlan CNI to provide the following benefits: Rich IPAM capabilities for underlay CNIs, including shared/fixed IPs, multi-NIC IP allocation, and dual-stack support One or more underlay NICs for Pods with coordinating routes between multiple NICs to ensure smooth communication with consistent request and reply data paths Enhanced connectivity between open-source underlay CNIs and hosts using additional veth network interfaces and route control. This enables clusterIP access, local health checks of applications, and much more How can you deploy containers using a single underlay CNI, when a cluster has multiple underlying setups? Some nodes in the cluster are virtual machines like VMware that don't enable promiscuous mode, while others are bare metal and connected to traditional switch networks. What CNI solution should be deployed on each type of node? Some bare metal nodes only have one SR-IOV high-speed NIC that provides 64 VFs. How can more pods run on such a node? Some bare metal nodes have an SR-IOV high-speed NIC capable of running low-latency applications, while others have only ordinary network cards for running regular applications. What CNI solution should be deployed on each type of node? By simultaneously deploying multiple underlay CNIs through Multus CNI configuration and Spiderpool's IPAM abilities, resources from various infrastructure nodes across the cluster can be integrated to solve these problems. For example, as shown in the above diagram, different nodes with varying networking capabilities in a cluster can use various underlay CNIs, such as SR-IOV CNI for nodes with SR-IOV network cards, Macvlan CNI for nodes with ordinary network cards, and ipvlan CNI for nodes with restricted network access (e.g., VMware virtual machines with limited layer 2 network forwarding). Use case: adding an auxiliary underlay CNI NIC for overlay CNI In overlay networks, Spiderpool uses Multus to add an overlay NIC (such as Calico or Cilium ) and multiple underlay NICs (such as Macvlan CNI or SR-IOV CNI) for each Pod. This offers several benefits: Rich IPAM features for underlay CNIs, including shared/fixed IPs, multi-NIC IP allocation, and dual-stack support. Route coordination for multiple underlay CNI NICs and an overlay NIC for Pods, ensuring the consistent request and reply data paths for smooth communication. Use the overlay NIC as the default one with route coordination and enable local host connectivity to enable clusterIP access, local health checks of applications, and forwarding overlay network traffic through overlay networks while forwarding underlay network traffic through underlay networks. The integration of Multus CNI and Spiderpool IPAM enables the collaboration of an overlay CNI and multiple underlay CNIs. For example, in clusters with nodes of varying network capabilities, Pods on bare-metal nodes can access both overlay and underlay NICs. Meanwhile, Pods on virtual machine nodes only serving east-west services are connected to the Overlay NIC. This approach provides several benefits: Applications providing east-west services can be restricted to being allocated only the overlay NIC while those providing north-south services can simultaneously access overlay and underlay NICs. This results in reduced Underlay IP resource usage, lower manual maintenance costs, and preserved pod connectivity within the cluster. Fully integrate resources from virtual machines and bare-metal nodes. Use case: underlay CNI on public cloud and VM It is hard to implement underlay CNI in public cloud, openstack, vmvare. It requires the vendor underlay CNI on specific environments, as these environments typically have the following limitations: The IAAS network infrastructure implements MAC restrictions for packets. On the one hand, security checks are conducted on the source MAC to ensure that the source MAC address is the same as the MAC address of VM network interface. On the other hand, restrictions have been placed on the destination MAC, which only supports packet forwarding by the MAC address of VM network interfaces. The MAC address of the Pod in the common CNI plugin is newly generated, which leads to Pod communication failure. The IAAS network infrastructure implements IP restrictions on packets. Only when the destination and source IP of the packet are assigned to VM, packet could be forwarded rightly. The common CNI plugin assigns IP addresses to Pods that do not comply with IAAS settings, which leads to Pod communication failure. Spiderpool provides IP pool based on node topology, aligning with IP allocation settings of VMs. In conjunction with ipvlan CNI, it provides underlay CNI solutions for various public cloud environments. Quick start Refer to Quick start , set up a cluster quickly. Major features For applications requiring static IP addresses, it could be supported by IP pools owning limited IP adddress set and pod affinity. See example for more details. For applications not requiring static IP addresses, they can share an IP pool. See example for more details. For stateful applications, IP addresses can be automatically fixed for each Pod, and the overall IP scaling range can be fixed as well. See example for more details. Subnet feature, on the one hand, could help to separate the responsibility from the infrastructure administrator and the application administrator. On the other hand, it supports to automatically create and dynamically scale the fixed IP ippools to each applcation requiring static IPs. which could help reduce operation burden of IP pools burden. See example for more details. In additional to kubernetes-native controller, subnet feature also supports third-party pod controllers based on operator. See example for details. For Pods of an application run across different network zones, it could assign IP addresses of different subnets. See example for details. Support to assign IP address from different subnets to multiple NICs of a Pod, and help coordinate policy route between interfaces to ensure consistent data path of request and reply packets. For scenarios involving multiple Underlay NICs, please refer to the example . For scenarios involving one Overlay NIC and multiple Underlay NICs, please refer to the example . It supports to set default IP pools for the cluster or for the namespace. Besides, A IP pool could be shared by the whole cluster or bound to a specified namespace. See example for details.

\u534f\u540c"},{"location":"concepts/arch/","text":"Spiderpool architecture Comparison of underlay and overlay network scenarios There are two technologies in cloud-native networking: \"overlay network\" and \"underlay network\". Despite no strict definition for underlay and overlay networks in cloud-native networking, we can simply abstract their characteristics from many CNI projects. The two technologies meet the needs of different scenarios. The article provides a brief comparison of IPAM and network performance between the two technologies, which offers better insights into the unique features and use cases of Spiderpool. Why underlay network solutions? In data center scenarios, the following requirements necessitate underlay network solutions: Low-latency applications need optimized network latency and throughput provided by underlay networks Initial migration of traditional host applications to the cloud use traditional network methods such as service exposure and discovery and multi subnets Network management in the data center desires security controls such as firewalls and traditional network observation techniques to implement cluster network monitoring. Architecture Spiderpool consists of the following components: Spiderpool controller: a set of deployments that manage CRD validation, status updates, IP recovery, and automated IP pools Spiderpool agent: a set of daemonsets that help Spiderpool plugin by performing IP allocation and coordinator plugin for information synchronization. Spiderpool plugin: a binary plugin on each host that CNI can utilize to implement IP allocation. coordinator plugin: a binary plugin on each host that CNI can use for multi-NIC route coordination, IP conflict detection, and host connectivity. On top of its own components, Spiderpool relies on open-source underlay CNIs to allocate network interfaces to Pods. You can use Multus CNI to manage multiple NICs and CNI configurations. Any CNI project compatible with third-party IPAM plugins can work well with Spiderpool, such as: Macvlan CNI , vlan CNI , ipvlan CNI , SR-IOV CNI , ovs CNI , Multus CNI , Calico CNI , Weave CNI Use case: collaborate with one or more underlay CNIs In underlay networks, Spiderpool can work with underlay CNIs such as Macvlan CNI and SR-IOV CNI to provide the following benefits: Rich IPAM capabilities for underlay CNIs, including shared/fixed IPs, multi-NIC IP allocation, and dual-stack support One or more underlay NICs for Pods with coordinating routes between multiple NICs to ensure smooth communication with consistent request and reply data paths Enhanced connectivity between open-source underlay CNIs and hosts using additional veth network interfaces and route control. This enables clusterIP access, local health checks of applications, and much more How can you deploy containers using a single underlay CNI, when a cluster has multiple underlying setups? Some nodes in the cluster are virtual machines like VMware that don't enable promiscuous mode, while others are bare metal and connected to traditional switch networks. What CNI solution should be deployed on each type of node? Some bare metal nodes only have one SR-IOV high-speed NIC that provides 64 VFs. How can more pods run on such a node? Some bare metal nodes have an SR-IOV high-speed NIC capable of running low-latency applications, while others have only ordinary network cards for running regular applications. What CNI solution should be deployed on each type of node? By simultaneously deploying multiple underlay CNIs through Multus CNI configuration and Spiderpool's IPAM abilities, resources from various infrastructure nodes across the cluster can be integrated to solve these problems. For example, as shown in the above diagram, different nodes with varying networking capabilities in a cluster can use various underlay CNIs, such as SR-IOV CNI for nodes with SR-IOV network cards, Macvlan CNI for nodes with ordinary network cards, and ipvlan CNI for nodes with restricted network access (e.g., VMware virtual machines with limited layer 2 network forwarding). Use case: collaborate with overlay and underlay CNIs In overlay networks, Spiderpool uses Multus to add an overlay NIC (such as Calico or Cilium ) and multiple underlay NICs (such as Macvlan CNI or SR-IOV CNI) for each Pod. This offers several benefits: Rich IPAM features for underlay CNIs, including shared/fixed IPs, multi-NIC IP allocation, and dual-stack support. Route coordination for multiple underlay CNI NICs and an overlay NIC for Pods, ensuring the consistent request and reply data paths for smooth communication. Use the overlay NIC as the default one with route coordination and enable local host connectivity to enable clusterIP access, local health checks of applications, and forwarding overlay network traffic through overlay networks while forwarding underlay network traffic through underlay networks. The integration of Multus CNI and Spiderpool IPAM enables the collaboration of an overlay CNI and multiple underlay CNIs. For example, in clusters with nodes of varying network capabilities, Pods on bare-metal nodes can access both overlay and underlay NICs. Meanwhile, Pods on virtual machine nodes only serving east-west services are connected to the Overlay NIC. This approach provides several benefits: Applications providing east-west services can be restricted to being allocated only the overlay NIC while those providing north-south services can simultaneously access overlay and underlay NICs. This results in reduced Underlay IP resource usage, lower manual maintenance costs, and preserved pod connectivity within the cluster. Fully integrate resources from virtual machines and bare-metal nodes.","title":"Architecture"},{"location":"concepts/arch/#spiderpool-architecture","text":"","title":"Spiderpool architecture"},{"location":"concepts/arch/#comparison-of-underlay-and-overlay-network-scenarios","text":"There are two technologies in cloud-native networking: \"overlay network\" and \"underlay network\". Despite no strict definition for underlay and overlay networks in cloud-native networking, we can simply abstract their characteristics from many CNI projects. The two technologies meet the needs of different scenarios. The article provides a brief comparison of IPAM and network performance between the two technologies, which offers better insights into the unique features and use cases of Spiderpool. Why underlay network solutions? In data center scenarios, the following requirements necessitate underlay network solutions: Low-latency applications need optimized network latency and throughput provided by underlay networks Initial migration of traditional host applications to the cloud use traditional network methods such as service exposure and discovery and multi subnets Network management in the data center desires security controls such as firewalls and traditional network observation techniques to implement cluster network monitoring.","title":"Comparison of underlay and overlay network scenarios"},{"location":"concepts/arch/#architecture","text":"Spiderpool consists of the following components: Spiderpool controller: a set of deployments that manage CRD validation, status updates, IP recovery, and automated IP pools Spiderpool agent: a set of daemonsets that help Spiderpool plugin by performing IP allocation and coordinator plugin for information synchronization. Spiderpool plugin: a binary plugin on each host that CNI can utilize to implement IP allocation. coordinator plugin: a binary plugin on each host that CNI can use for multi-NIC route coordination, IP conflict detection, and host connectivity. On top of its own components, Spiderpool relies on open-source underlay CNIs to allocate network interfaces to Pods. You can use Multus CNI to manage multiple NICs and CNI configurations. Any CNI project compatible with third-party IPAM plugins can work well with Spiderpool, such as: Macvlan CNI , vlan CNI , ipvlan CNI , SR-IOV CNI , ovs CNI , Multus CNI , Calico CNI , Weave CNI","title":"Architecture"},{"location":"concepts/arch/#use-case-collaborate-with-one-or-more-underlay-cnis","text":"In underlay networks, Spiderpool can work with underlay CNIs such as Macvlan CNI and SR-IOV CNI to provide the following benefits: Rich IPAM capabilities for underlay CNIs, including shared/fixed IPs, multi-NIC IP allocation, and dual-stack support One or more underlay NICs for Pods with coordinating routes between multiple NICs to ensure smooth communication with consistent request and reply data paths Enhanced connectivity between open-source underlay CNIs and hosts using additional veth network interfaces and route control. This enables clusterIP access, local health checks of applications, and much more How can you deploy containers using a single underlay CNI, when a cluster has multiple underlying setups? Some nodes in the cluster are virtual machines like VMware that don't enable promiscuous mode, while others are bare metal and connected to traditional switch networks. What CNI solution should be deployed on each type of node? Some bare metal nodes only have one SR-IOV high-speed NIC that provides 64 VFs. How can more pods run on such a node? Some bare metal nodes have an SR-IOV high-speed NIC capable of running low-latency applications, while others have only ordinary network cards for running regular applications. What CNI solution should be deployed on each type of node? By simultaneously deploying multiple underlay CNIs through Multus CNI configuration and Spiderpool's IPAM abilities, resources from various infrastructure nodes across the cluster can be integrated to solve these problems. For example, as shown in the above diagram, different nodes with varying networking capabilities in a cluster can use various underlay CNIs, such as SR-IOV CNI for nodes with SR-IOV network cards, Macvlan CNI for nodes with ordinary network cards, and ipvlan CNI for nodes with restricted network access (e.g., VMware virtual machines with limited layer 2 network forwarding).","title":"Use case: collaborate with one or more underlay CNIs"},{"location":"concepts/arch/#use-case-collaborate-with-overlay-and-underlay-cnis","text":"In overlay networks, Spiderpool uses Multus to add an overlay NIC (such as Calico or Cilium ) and multiple underlay NICs (such as Macvlan CNI or SR-IOV CNI) for each Pod.

Performance Testing English | \u7b80\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587 Spiderpool is a high-performance IPAM CNI plugin for underlay networks. This report will compare its performance with the mainstream underlay IPAM CNI plugins (such as Whereabouts , Kube-OVN ) and the widely used overlay IPAM CNI plugin calico-ipam under the \"1000 Pod\" scenario. Background Why do we need to do performance testing on the underlay IPAM CNI plugin? The speed at which IPAM allocates IP addresses largely determines the speed of application publishing. Underlay IPAM often becomes a performance bottleneck when a large-scale Kubernetes cluster recovers from failures. Under underlay networks, private IPv4 addresses are limited. Within a limited range of IP addresses, concurrent creation of Pods can involve IP address preemption and conflict, and it is challenging to quickly adjust the limited IP address resources.

Competition occurs when multiple Pods in a cluster allocate IP addresses from the same pool. Support hosting the entire lifecycle of an IP pool, synchronizing it with workload creation, scaling, deletion, and reducing concurrency or storage issues caused by overly large shared pools. macvlan v1.1.1 Whereabouts (CRD backend) v0.6.1 Each Node can define its own available IP pool ranges. If there are duplicate IP addresses defined between Nodes, these IP addresses are promoted as a shared resource. Kube-OVN (underlay) v1.11.3 Kube-OVN v1.11.3 IP addresses are organized by Subnet. Each Namespace can belong to a specific Subnet. Pods under the Namespace will automatically obtain IP addresses from the Subnet they belong to. Subnets are also a cluster resource, and the IP addresses of the same Subnet can be distributed on any Node. Calico v3.23.3 calico-ipam (CRD backend) v3.23.3 Each Node has one or more IP blocks exclusively, and the Pods on each Node only use the IP addresses in the local IP block. There is no competition or conflict between Nodes, and the allocation efficiency is very high. Plan During the testing, we will follow the following agreement: Testing under IPv4 stack and IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack. When testing the underlay IPAM CNI plugins, ensure that the number of available IP addresses is 1:1 to the number of Pods as much as possible. For example, if we plan to create 1000 Pods in the next step, we should limit the number of available IPv4/IPv6 addresses to 1000. Specifically, we will attempt to create a total of 1000 Pods on the Kubernetes cluster in the following two ways, and record the time taken for all Pods to become Running : Create only one Deployment with 1000 replicas. Create 100 Deployments with 10 replicas per Deployment. Then, we will use the following command to delete these 1000 Pods at once, and record the time it took for all Pods to become Running : kubectl get pod | grep \"prefix\" | awk '{print $1}' | xargs kubectl delete pod Next, power down all nodes and then power up, simulate fault recovery, and record the time it took for all Pods to become Running again.

are two technologies in cloud-native networking: \"overlay network\" and \"underlay network\". Despite no strict definition for underlay and overlay networks in cloud-native networking, we can simply abstract their characteristics from many CNI projects. The two technologies meet the needs of different scenarios. Spiderpool is designed for underlay networks, and the following comparison of the two solutions can better illustrate the features and usage scenarios of Spiderpool. IPAM for overlay networks These solutions implement the decoupling of the Pod network and host network, such as Calico , Cilium and other CNI plugins. Typically, they use tunnel technology such as vxlan to build an overlay network plane, and use NAT technology for north-south traffic. These IPAM solutions have the following characteristics: Divide Pod subnets into node-based IP blocks In terms of a smaller subnet mask, the Pod subnet is divided into smaller IP blocks, and each node is assigned one or more IP blocks depending on the actual IP allocation account. First, since the IPAM plugin on each node only needs to allocate and release IP addresses in the local IP block, there is no IP allocation conflict with IPAM on other nodes, achieving more efficient allocation. Second, a specific IP address follows an IP block and is allocated within one node all the time, so it cannot be assigned on other nodes together with a bound Pod. Sufficient IP address resources Subnets not overlapping with any CIDR, could be used by the cluster, so the cluster has enough IP address resources as long as NAT technology is used in an appropriate manner. As a result, IPAM components face less pressure to reclaim abnormal IP addresses. No requirement for static IP addresses For the static IP address requirement, there is a difference between a stateless application and a stateful application. Regarding stateless application like deployment, the Pod's name will change when the Pod restarts, and the business logic of the application itself is stateless. Thus static IP addresses means that all the Pod replicas are fixed in a set of IP addresses; for stateful applications such as statefulset, considering both the fixed information including Pod's names and stateful business logic, the strong binding of one Pod and one specific IP address needs to be implemented for static IP addresses. The \"overlay network solution\" mostly exposes the ingress and source addresses of services to the outside of the cluster with the help of NAT technology, and realizes the east-west communication through DNS, clusterIP and other technologies. In addition, although the IP block of IPAM fixes the IP to one node, it does not guarantee the application replicas follow the scheduling. Therefore, there is no scope for the static IP address capability. Most of the mainstream CNIs in the community have not yet supported \"static IP addressed\", or support it in a rough way. The advantage of the \"overlay network solution\" is that the CNI plugins are highly compatible with any underlying network environment, and can provide independent subnets with sufficient IP addresses for Pods. These solutions share the node's network for Pods, which means Pods can directly obtain IP addresses in the node network. Thus, applications can directly use their own IP addresses for east-west and north-south communications. There are two typical scenarios for underlay network solutions: clusters deployed on a \"legacy network\" and clusters deployed on an IAAS environment, such as a public cloud. The following summarizes the IPAM characteristics of the \"legacy network scenario\": An IP address able to be assigned to any node As the number of network devices in the data center increases and multi-cluster technology evolves, IPv4 address resources become scarce, thus requiring IPAM to improve the efficiency of IP usage. As the Pod replicas of the applications requiring \"static IP addresses\" could be scheduled to any node in the cluster and drift between nodes, IP addresses might drift together. Therefore, an IP address should be able to be allocated to a Pod on any node. Different replicas within one application could obtain IP addresses across subnets Take as an example one node could access subnet 172.20.1.0/24 while another node just only access subnet 172.20.2.0/24. In this case, when the replicas within one application need to be deployed across subnets, IPAM is required to be able to assign subnet-matched IP addresses to the application on different nodes. Static IP addresses For some traditional applications, the source IPs or destination IPs need to be sensed in the microservice. And network admins are used to enabling fine-grained network security control via firewalls and other means. Therefore, in order to reduce the transformation chores after the applications move to the Kubernetes, applications need static IP addresses. Pods with Multiple NICs need IP addresses of different underlay subnets Since the Pod is connected to an underlay network, it has the need for multiple NICs to reach different underlay subnets. IP conflict Underlay networks are more prone to IP conflicts. For instance, Pods conflict with host IPs outside the cluster, or conflict with other clusters under the same subnet. But it is difficult for IPAM to discover these conflicting IP addresses externally unless CNI plugins are involved for real-time IP conflict detection. Release and recover IP addresses Because of the scarcity of IP addresses in underlay networks and the static IP address requirements of applications, a newly launched Pod may fail due to the lack of IP addresses owing to some IP addresses not being released by abnormal Pods. This requires IPAMs to have a more accurate, efficient and timely IP recovery mechanism. The advantages of the underlay network solution include: no need for network NAT mapping, which makes cloud-based network transformation for applications way more convenient; the underlying network firewall and other devices can achieve relatively fine control of Pod communication; no tunneling technology contributes to improved throughput and latency performance of network communications. Performance comparison between overlay CNIs and underlay CNIs Overlay CNIs rely on tunnel encapsulation and host forwarding to achieve Pod communication across nodes, while underlay CNIs can directly access the host network without tunneling overhead. This results in differences in network latency and throughput performance. To compare the performance of different CNI solutions, tests were conducted on a cluster with two bare-metal nodes equipped with 25G Mellanox CX5 NICs: Network interface performance between the two bare-metal nodes Cross-node Pod network performance based on Macvlan Cross-node Pod network performance based on SR-IOV Cross-node Pod network performance based on Calico(v3.23) vxlan Cross-node Pod network performance based on Cilium(v1.13) vxlan As shown in the above figure, the test results demonstrate that underlay CNIs like Macvlan and SR-IOV outperform overlay solutions.","title":"Underlay and overlay solutions"},{"location":"concepts/solution/#underlay-and-overlay-network-solutions","text":"There are two technologies in cloud-native networking: \"overlay network\" and \"underlay network\". Despite no strict definition for underlay and overlay networks in cloud-native networking, we can simply abstract their characteristics from many CNI projects. The two technologies meet the needs of different scenarios. Spiderpool is designed for underlay networks, and the following comparison of the two solutions can better illustrate the features and usage scenarios of Spiderpool.","title":"Underlay and overlay network solutions"},{"location":"concepts/solution/#ipam-for-overlay-networks","text":"These solutions implement the decoupling of the Pod network and host network, such as Calico , Cilium and other CNI plugins. Typically, they use tunnel technology such as vxlan to build an overlay network plane, and use NAT technology for north-south traffic. These IPAM solutions have the following characteristics: Divide Pod subnets into node-based IP blocks In terms of a smaller subnet mask, the Pod subnet is divided into smaller IP blocks, and each node is assigned one or more IP blocks depending on the actual IP allocation account. First, since the IPAM plugin on each node only needs to allocate and release IP addresses in the local IP block, there is no IP allocation conflict with IPAM on other nodes, achieving more efficient allocation. Second, a specific IP address follows an IP block and is allocated within one node all the time, so it cannot be assigned on other nodes together with a bound Pod. Sufficient IP address resources Subnets not overlapping with any CIDR, could be used by the cluster, so the cluster has enough IP address resources as long as NAT technology is used in an appropriate manner. As a result, IPAM components face less pressure to reclaim abnormal IP addresses. No requirement for static IP addresses For the static IP address requirement, there is a difference between a stateless application and a stateful application. Regarding stateless application like deployment, the Pod's name will change when the Pod restarts, and the business logic of the application itself is stateless. Thus static IP addresses means that all the Pod replicas are fixed in a set of IP addresses; for stateful applications such as statefulset, considering both the fixed information including Pod's names and stateful business logic, the strong binding of one Pod and one specific IP address needs to be implemented for static IP addresses. The \"overlay network solution\" mostly exposes the ingress and source addresses of services to the outside of the cluster with the help of NAT technology, and realizes the east-west communication through DNS, clusterIP and other technologies. In addition, although the IP block of IPAM fixes the IP to one node, it does not guarantee the application replicas follow the scheduling. Therefore, there is no scope for the static IP address capability. Most of the mainstream CNIs in the community have not yet supported \"static IP addressed\", or support it in a rough way. The advantage of the \"overlay network solution\" is that the CNI plugins are highly compatible with any underlying network environment, and can provide independent subnets with sufficient IP addresses for Pods. These solutions share the node's network for Pods, which means Pods can directly obtain IP addresses in the node network. Thus, applications can directly use their own IP addresses for east-west and north-south communications. There are two typical scenarios for underlay network solutions: clusters deployed on a \"legacy network\" and clusters deployed on an IAAS environment, such as a public cloud. The following summarizes the IPAM characteristics of the \"legacy network scenario\": An IP address able to be assigned to any node As the number of network devices in the data center increases and multi-cluster technology evolves, IPv4 address resources become scarce, thus requiring IPAM to improve the efficiency of IP usage. As the Pod replicas of the applications requiring \"static IP addresses\" could be scheduled to any node in the cluster and drift between nodes, IP addresses might drift together. Therefore, an IP address should be able to be allocated to a Pod on any node. Different replicas within one application could obtain IP addresses across subnets Take as an example one node could access subnet 172.20.1.0/24 while another node just only access subnet 172.20.2.0/24. In this case, when the replicas within one application need to be deployed across subnets, IPAM is required to be able to assign subnet-matched IP addresses to the application on different nodes.

rising popularity of private cloud data centers has made underlay networks essential components of data center network architecture by offering efficient network transmission and improved network topology management capabilities. Underlay is widely used in the following scenarios due to its low latency, reliability, and security: Latency-sensitive applications: applications in specific industries, such as financial trading and real-time video transmission, are highly sensitive to network latency. Underlay networks directly control physical and link-layer connections to reduce data transmission time, providing an ideal solution for these applications. Firewall security control and management: firewalls are often used to manage north-south traffic, namely communication between internal and external networks, by checking, filtering, and restricting communication traffic. IP address management (IPAM) solutions of underlay networks that allocate fixed egress IP addresses for applications can provide better communication management and control between the cluster and external networks, further enhancing overall network security. In the cluster of the Underlay network, when its nodes are distributed in different regions or data centers, and some node regions can only use specific subnets, it will bring challenges to IP address management (IPAM). This article will introduce a method that can realize A complete underlay network solution for IP allocation across network regions. Project Functions Spiderpool provides the function of node topology, which can help solve the problem of IP allocation across network regions. Its implementation principle is as follows. A cluster, but the nodes of the cluster are distributed in different regions or data centers, some nodes' regions can only use the subnet 10.6.1.0/24, and some nodes' regions can only use the subnet 172.16.2.0/24. In the appeal scenario, when an application deploys copies across subnets, IPAM is required to assign IP addresses that match the subnet to different Pods under the same application on different nodes. Spiderpool's CR: SpiderIPPool The nodeName field is provided to realize the affinity between the IP pool and the node, so that when the Pod is scheduled to a certain node, it can obtain the IP address from the Underlay subnet where the node is located, and realize the node topology function. Implementation Requirements Installed Helm . Steps Clusters spanning network regions Prepare a set of clusters that span the network area. For example, node 1 uses 10.6.0.0/16 and node 2 uses 10.7.0.0/16 subnet. The following is the cluster information and network topology used: ~# kubectl get nodes -owide NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION INTERNAL-IP EXTERNAL-IP controller-node-1 Ready control-plane 1h v1.25.3 10 .6.168.71 <none> worker-node-1 Ready <none> 1h v1.25.3 10 .7.168.73 <none> ~# kubectl get nodes --show-labels NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION LABELS controller-node-1 Ready control-plane,master 1h v1.25.3 node-subnet = subnet-6, ... worker-node-1 Ready <none> 1h v1.25.3 node-subnet = subnet-7, ...

Underlay is widely used in the following scenarios due to its low latency, reliability, and security: Latency-sensitive applications: applications in specific industries, such as financial trading and real-time video transmission, are highly sensitive to network latency. Underlay networks directly control physical and link-layer connections to reduce data transmission time, providing an ideal solution for these applications. Firewall security control and management: firewalls are often used to manage north-south traffic, namely communication between internal and external networks, by checking, filtering, and restricting communication traffic. IP address management (IPAM) solutions of underlay networks that allocate fixed egress IP addresses for applications can provide better communication management and control between the cluster and external networks, further enhancing overall network security. In the cluster of the Underlay network, when its nodes are distributed in different regions or data centers, and some node regions can only use specific subnets, it will bring challenges to IP address management (IPAM).

If you specify both of them two, it only uses ipam.spidernet.io/subnets mode. In annotation ipam.spidernet.io/subnet mode, it will use default interface name eth0 if you do not set interface property. For annotation ipam.spidernet.io/ippool-ip-number , you can use '2' for fixed IP number or '+2' for flexible mode. The value '+2' means the SpiderSubnet auto-created IPPool will add 2 more IPs based on your application replicas. If you choose to use flexible mode, the auto-created IPPool IPs will expand or shrink dynamically by your application replicas. This is an optional annotation. If left unset, it will use the clusterSubnetDefaultFlexibleIPNumber property from the spiderpool-conf ConfigMap as the flexible IP number in flexible mode. Refer to config for details. The current version only supports using one SpiderSubnet V4/V6 CR for one Interface. You shouldn't specify two or more SpiderSubnet V4 CRs. The system will choose the first one to use. It's invalid to modify the Auto-created IPPool Spec.IPs by users. The auto-created IPPool will only serve your specified application, and the system will bind a special Spiderpool podAffinity to it.

So Spiderpool treats them as stateless Pod like Deployment , this means Pods created by none kubernetes-native controller is able to fix the IP range like Deployment , but not able to bind each Pod to a specific IP address like Statefulset .","title":"Description"},{"location":"usage/third-party-controller/#get-started","text":"It will use OpenKruise to demonstrate how Spiderpool supports third-party controllers.","title":"Get Started"},{"location":"usage/third-party-controller/#set-up-spiderpool","text":"See installation for more details.","title":"Set up Spiderpool"},{"location":"usage/third-party-controller/#set-up-openkruise","text":"Please refer to OpenKruise","title":"Set up OpenKruise"},{"location":"usage/third-party-controller/#create-pod-by-manual-ippool-way","text":"Create a custom IPPool. kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spidernet-io/spiderpool/main/docs/example/basic/custom-ipv4-ippool.yaml apiVersion : spiderpool.spidernet.io/v2beta1 kind : SpiderIPPool metadata : name : custom-ipv4-ippool spec : subnet : 172.18.41.0/24 ips : - 172.18.41.40-172.18.41.50 Create an OpenKruise CloneSet that has 3 replicas, and sepecify the ippool by annotations ipam.spidernet.io/ippool apiVersion : apps.kruise.io/v1alpha1 kind : CloneSet metadata : name : custom-kruise-cloneset spec : replicas : 3 selector : matchLabels : app : custom-kruise-cloneset template : metadata : annotations : ipam.spidernet.io/ippool : |- { \"ipv4\": [\"custom-ipv4-ippool\"] } labels : app : custom-kruise-cloneset spec : containers : - name : custom-kruise-cloneset image : busybox imagePullPolicy : IfNotPresent command : [ \"/bin/sh\" , \"-c\" , \"trap : TERM INT; sleep infinity & wait\" ] As expected, Pods of OpenKruise CloneSet custom-kruise-cloneset will be assigned with IP addresses from IPPool custom-ipv4-ippool . kubectl get po -l app = custom-kruise-cloneset -o wide NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE IP NODE NOMINATED NODE READINESS GATES custom-kruise-cloneset-8m9ls 1 /1 Running 0 96s 172 .18.41.44 spider-worker <none> 2 /2 custom-kruise-cloneset-c4z9f 1 /1 Running 0 96s 172 .18.41.50 spider-worker <none> 2 /2 custom-kruise-cloneset-w9kfm 1 /1 Running 0 96s 172 .18.41.46 spider-worker <none> 2 /2","title":"Create Pod by Manual ippool way"},{"location":"usage/third-party-controller/#create-pod-by-automatical-ippool-way","text":"Create an OpenKruise CloneSet that has 3 replicas, and specify the subnet by annotations ipam.spidernet.io/subnet apiVersion : apps.kruise.io/v1alpha1 kind : CloneSet metadata : name : custom-kruise-cloneset spec : replicas : 3 selector : matchLabels : app : custom-kruise-cloneset template : metadata : annotations : ipam.spidernet.io/subnet : |- {\"ipv4\": [\"subnet-demo-v4\"], \"ipv6\": [\"subnet-demo-v6\"]} ipam.spidernet.io/ippool-ip-number : \"5\" labels : app : custom-kruise-cloneset spec : containers : - name : custom-kruise-cloneset image : busybox imagePullPolicy : IfNotPresent command : [ \"/bin/sh\" , \"-c\" , \"trap : TERM INT; sleep infinity & wait\" ] NOTICE: You must specify a fixed IP number for auto-created IPPool like ipam.spidernet.io/ippool-ip-number: \"5\" .

If you don't need external clients to access pod IPs directly, skip this step. The network topology is as follows: Configure a host outside the cluster as BGP Router We will use an Ubuntu server as BGP Router. FRR needs to be installed beforehand: root@router:~# apt install -y frr FRR enable BGP: root@router:~# sed -i 's/bgpd=no/bgpd=yes/' /etc/frr/daemons root@router:~# systemctl restart frr Configure FRR: root@router:~# vtysh router# config router ( config ) # router bgp 23000 router ( config ) # bgp router-id 172.16.13.1 router ( config ) # neighbor 172.16.13.11 remote-as 64512 router ( config ) # neighbor 172.16.13.21 remote-as 64512 router ( config ) # no bgp ebgp-requires-policy Configuration descriptions: The AS on the router side is 23000 , and the AS on the cluster node side is 64512 . The BGP neighbor relationship between the router and the node is ebgp, while the relationship between the nodes is ibgp. ebgp-requires-policy needs to be disabled, otherwise the BGP session cannot be established. 172.16.13.11/21 is the IP address of the cluster node. For more information, refer to frrouting .

assigning static IP addresses in underlay networks. In this page, we'll demonstrate how to build a complete underlay network solution using Multus , Macvlan and Spiderpool , which meets the following kinds of requirements: Applications can be assigned static Underlay IP addresses through simple operations. Pods with multiple Underlay NICs connect to multiple Underlay subnets. Pods can communicate in various ways, such as Pod IP, clusterIP, and nodePort. Prerequisites Make sure a Kubernetes cluster is ready. Helm has been already installed. Install Macvlan Macvlan is a CNI plugin that allows pods to be assigned Macvlan virtual NICs for connecting to Underlay networks. Some Kubernetes installers include the Macvlan binary file by default that can be found at \"/opt/cni/bin/macvlan\" on your nodes. If the binary file is missing, you can download and install it on all nodes using the following command: wget https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/releases/download/v1.2.0/cni-plugins-linux-amd64-v1.2.0.tgz tar xvfzp ./cni-plugins-linux-amd64-v1.2.0.tgz -C /opt/cni/bin chmod +x /opt/cni/bin/macvlan Install Spiderpool Install Spiderpool. helm repo add spiderpool https://spidernet-io.github.io/spiderpool helm repo update spiderpool helm install spiderpool spiderpool/spiderpool --namespace kube-system --set multus.multusCNI.defaultCniCRName = \"macvlan-conf\" If you are mainland user who is not available to access ghcr.io\uff0cYou can specify the parameter -set global.imageRegistryOverride=ghcr.m.daocloud.io to avoid image pulling failures for Spiderpool. Specify the Multus clusterNetwork of the cluster through multus.multusCNI.defaultCniCRName , clusterNetwork is a specific field of the Multus plugin, which is used to specify the default network interface of the Pod. Create a SpiderIPPool instance. Create an IP Pool in the same subnet as the network interface eth0 for Pods to use, the following is an example of creating a related SpiderIPPool: cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f - apiVersion: spiderpool.spidernet.io/v2beta1 kind: SpiderIPPool metadata: name: ippool-test spec: ips: - \"172.18.30.131-172.18.30.140\" subnet: 172.18.0.0/16 gateway: 172.18.0.1 multusName: - macvlan-conf EOF Verify installation ~# kubectl get po -n kube-system | grep spiderpool spiderpool-agent-7hhkz 1 /1 Running 0 13m spiderpool-agent-kxf27 1 /1 Running 0 13m spiderpool-controller-76798dbb68-xnktr 1 /1 Running 0 13m spiderpool-init 0 /1 Completed 0 13m spiderpool-multus-7vkm2 1 /1 Running 0 13m spiderpool-multus-rwzjn 1 /1 Running 0 13m ~# kubectl get sp NAME VERSION SUBNET ALLOCATED-IP-COUNT TOTAL-IP-COUNT DISABLE ippool-test 4 172 .18.0.0/16 0 10 false Create CNI configuration To simplify writing Multus CNI configuration in JSON format, Spiderpool provides SpiderMultusConfig CR to automatically manage Multus NetworkAttachmentDefinition CR.

examples to build a complete Underlay network solution that exposes the available bridges as node resources for use by the cluster. Prerequisites Make sure a multi-node Kubernetes cluster is ready. Helm has been already installed. Open vSwitch must be installed and running on the host. It could refer to Installation . The following examples are based on Ubuntu 22.04.1. installation may vary depending on the host system. ~# sudo apt-get install -y openvswitch-switch ~# sudo systemctl start openvswitch-switch Install Ovs-cni ovs-cni is a Kubernetes CNI plugin based on Open vSwitch (OVS) that provides a way to use OVS for network virtualization in a Kubernetes cluster in a Kubernetes cluster. Verify that the binary /opt/cni/bin/ovs exists on the node. if the binary is missing, you can download it and install it on all nodes using the following command: ~# wget https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/ovs-cni/releases/download/v0.31.1/plugin ~# mv ./plugin /opt/cni/bin/ovs ~# chmod +x /opt/cni/bin/ovs Note: Ovs-cni does not configure bridges, it is up to the user to create them and connect them to L2, L3, The following is an example of creating a bridge, to be executed on each node: Create an Open vSwitch bridge. ~# ovs-vsctl add-br br1 Network interface connected to the bridge\uff1a This procedure depends on your platform, the following commands are only example instructions and it may break your system. First use ip link show to query the host for available interfaces, the example uses the interface on the host: eth0 as an example. ~# ovs-vsctl add-port br1 eth0 ~# ip addr add <IP\u5730\u5740>/<\u5b50\u7f51\u63a9\u7801> dev br1 ~# ip link set br1 up ~# ip route add default via <\u9ed8\u8ba4\u7f51\u5173IP> dev br1 Once created, the following bridge information can be viewed on each node: ~# ovs-vsctl show ec16d9e1-6187-4b21-9c2f-8b6cb75434b9 Bridge br1 Port eth0 Interface eth0 Port br1 Interface br1 type: internal Port veth97fb4795 Interface veth97fb4795 ovs_version: \"2.17.3\" Install Spiderpool Install Spiderpool helm repo add spiderpool https://spidernet-io.github.io/spiderpool helm repo update spiderpool helm install spiderpool spiderpool/spiderpool --namespace kube-system --set multus.multusCNI.defaultCniCRName = \"ovs-conf\" If you are mainland user who is not available to access ghcr.io\uff0cYou can specify the parameter -set global.imageRegistryOverride=ghcr.m.daocloud.io to avoid image pulling failures for Spiderpool. Specify the Multus clusterNetwork of the cluster through multus.multusCNI.defaultCniCRName , clusterNetwork is a specific field of the Multus plugin, which is used to specify the default network interface of the Pod. Create a SpiderIPPool instance. The Pod will obtain an IP address from the IPPool for underlying network communication, so the subnet of the IPPool needs to correspond to the underlying subnet being accessed.

Start English | \u7b80\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587 Spiderpool provides a solution for assigning static IP addresses in underlay networks. In this page, we'll demonstrate how to build a complete underlay network solution using Multus , Sriov , Veth , and Spiderpool , which meets the following kinds of requirements: Applications can be assigned static Underlay IP addresses through simple operations. Pods with multiple Underlay NICs connect to multiple Underlay subnets. Pods can communicate in various ways, such as Pod IP, clusterIP, and nodePort. Prerequisites Make sure a Kubernetes cluster is ready Helm has already been installed A SR-IOV-enabled NIC Check the NIC's bus-info: ~# ethtool -i enp4s0f0np0 | grep bus-info bus-info: 0000 :04:00.0 Check whether the NIC supports SR-IOV via bus-info. If the Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) field appears, it means that SR-IOV is supported: ~# lspci -s 0000 :04:00.0 -v | grep SR-IOV Capabilities: [ 180 ] Single Root I/O Virtualization ( SR-IOV ) Install Sriov-network-operator SriovNetwork helps us install sriov-cni and sriov-device-plugin components, making it easier to use sriov-cni: Install sriov-network-operator git clone https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/sriov-network-operator.git && cd sriov-network-operator/deployment helm install -n sriov-network-operator --create-namespace --set operator.resourcePrefix = spidernet.io --wait sriov-network-operator ./ You may need to label SR-IOV worker nodes using node-role.kubernetes.io/worker=\"\" label, if not already. By default, SR-IOV Operator will be deployed in namespace 'openshift-sriov-network-operator'. After installation, the node may reboot automatically. If necessary, install sriov-network-operator to the designated worker nodes. Configure sriov-network-operator Firstly, check the status of SriovNetworkNodeState CRs to confirm that sriov-network-operator has found a network card on the node that supports the SR-IOV feature. ```shell $ kubectl get sriovnetworknodestates.sriovnetwork.openshift.io -n sriov-network-operator node-1 -o yaml apiVersion: sriovnetwork.openshift.io/v1 kind: SriovNetworkNodeState spec: ... status: interfaces: - deviceID: \"1017\" driver: mlx5_core linkSpeed: 10000 Mb/s linkType: ETH mac: 04:3f:72:d0:d2:86 mtu: 1500 name: enp4s0f0np0 pciAddress: \"0000:04:00.0\" totalvfs: 8 vendor: 15b3 - deviceID: \"1017\" driver: mlx5_core linkSpeed: 10000 Mb/s linkType: ETH mac: 04:3f:72:d0:d2:87 mtu: 1500 name: enp4s0f1np1 pciAddress: \"0000:04:00.1\" totalvfs: 8 vendor: 15b3 syncStatus: Succeeded ``` As can be seen from the above, interfaces 'enp4s0f0np0' and 'enp4s0f1np1' on node 'node-1' both have SR-IOV capability and support a maximum number of VFs of 8.

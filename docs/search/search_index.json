Introduction Spiderpool: An IP Address Management (IPAM) CNI plugin of Kubernetes for managing static ip for underlay network. Spiderpool can work well with any CNI project that is compatible with third-party IPAM plugins. Why Spiderpool? Given that there has not yet been a comprehensive, user-friendly and intelligent open source solution for what underlay networks' IPAMs need, Spiderpool comes in to eliminate the complexity of allocating IP addresses to underlay networks. With the hope of the operations of IP allocation being as simple as some overlay-network CNI, Spiderpool supports many features, such as static application IP addresses, dynamic scalability of IP addresses, multi-NIC, dual-stack support, etc. Hopefully, Spiderpool will be a new IPAM alternative for open source enthusiasts. IPAM for underlay and overlay network There are two technologies in cloud-native networking: \"overlay network\" and \"underlay network\". Despite no strict definition for underlay and overlay networks in cloud-native networking, we can simply abstract their characteristics from many CNI projects. The two technologies meet the needs of different scenarios. Spiderpool is designed for underlay networks, and the following comparison of the two solutions can better illustrate the features and usage scenarios of Spiderpool. Overlay network solution These solutions implement the decoupling of POD network and host network, such as Calico , Cilium and other CNI plugins. Typically, They use tunnel technology such as vxlan to build an overlay network plane, and use NAT technology for north-south traffic. These IPAM solutions has some characteristics: divide pod subnet into node-based IP block In terms of a smaller subnet mask, the pod subnet is divided into smaller IP blocks, and each node is assigned one or more IP blocks depending on the actual IP allocation account. First, since the IPAM plugin on each node only needs to allocate and release IP addresses in the local IP block, there is no IP allocation conflict with IPAM on other nodes, and achieve more efficient allocation. Second, a specific IP address follows an IP block and is allocated within one node all the time, so it cannot be assigned on other nodes together with a bound POD. Sufficient IP address resources subnets not overlapping with any CIDR, could be used by the cluster, so the cluster have enough IP address resources as long as NAT technology is used in an appropriate manner. As a result, IPAM components face less pressure to reclaim abnormal IP address. No requirement for static IP addresses For the static IP address requirement, there is a difference between stateless application and stateful application. Regarding stateless application like deployment, the POD's name will change when the POD restarts, the business logic of the application itself is stateless, so static IP addresses means that all the POD replicas are fixed in a set of IP addresses; for stateful applications such as statefulset, considering both the fixed information including POD's names and stateful business logic, the strong binding of one POD and one specific IP address needs to be implemented for static IP addresses. The \"overlay network solution\" mostly exposes the ingress and source addresses of services to the outside of the cluster with the help of NAT technology, and realizes the east-west communication through DNS, clusterIP and other technologies. In addition, although the IP block of IPAM fixes the IP to one node, it does not guarantee the application replicas to follow the scheduling.Therefore, there is no scope for the static IP address capability. Most of the mainstream CNIs in the community have not yet supported \"static IP addressed\", or support it in a rough way. The advantage of the \"overlay network solution\" is that the CNI plugins are highly compatible with any underlying network environment, and can provide independent subnets with sufficient IP addresses for PODs. Underlay network solution This solution shares node's network for PODs, which means PODs can directly obtain IP addresses in the node network. Thus, applications can directly use their own IP addresses for east-west and north-south communications. There are two typical scenarios for underlay network solutions\uff1aclusters deployed on a \"legacy network\" and clusters deployed on an IAAS environment, such as a public cloud. The following summarizes the IPAM characteristics of the \"legacy network scenario\": An IP address able to be assigned to any node As the number of network devices in the data center increases and multi-cluster technology evolves, IPv4 address resources become scarce, thus requiring IPAM to improve the efficiency of IP usage. As the POD replicas of the applications requiring \"static IP addresses\" could be scheduled to any node in the cluster and drift between nodes, IP addresses might drift together. Therefore, an IP address should be able to be allocated to a POD on any node. Different replicas within one application could obtain IP addresses across subnets Take as an example one node could access subnet 172.20.1.0/24 while another node just only access subnet 172.20.2.0/24. In this case, when the replicas within one application need be deployed across subnets, IPAM is required to be able to assign subnet-matched IP addresses to the application on different nodes. Static IP addresses For some traditional applications, the source IPs or destination IPs needs to be sensed in the microservice. And network admins are used to enabling fine-grained network security control via firewalls and other means. Therefore, in order to reduce the transformation chores after the applications move to the kubernetes, applications need static IP address. Pods with Multiple NICs need IP addresses of different underlay subnets Since the POD is connected to an underlay network, it has the need for multiple NICs to reach different underlay subnets. IP conflict Underlay networks are more prone to IP conflicts. For instance, PODs conflict with host IPs outside the cluster, or conflict with other clusters under the same subnet. But it is difficult for IPAM to discover these conflicting IP addresses externally unless CNI plugins are involved for real-time IP conflict detection. Release and recover IP addresses Because of the scarcity of IP addresses in underlay networks and the static IP address requirements of applications, a newly launched POD may fail due to the lack of IP addresses owing to some IP addresses not released by abnormal Pods. This requires IPAMs to have a more accurate, efficient and timely IP recovery mechanism. The advantages of the underlay network solution include: no need for network NAT mapping, which makes cloud-based network transformation for applications way more convenient; the underlying network firewall and other devices can achieve relatively fine control of POD communication; no tunneling technology contributes to improved throughput and latency performance of network communications. Architecture For the architecture of spiderpool, refer to Architecture . Supported CNIs Any CNI project compatible with third-party IPAM plugins, can work well with spiderpool, such as: macvlan CNI , vlan CNI , ipvlan CNI , sriov CNI , ovs CNI , Multus CNI , calico CNI , weave CNI Quick start If you want to start some Pods with Spiderpool in minutes, refer to Quick start . Major features Multiple subnet objects The administrator can create multiple subnets objects mapping to each underlay CIDR, and applications can be assigned IP addresses within different subnets. to meet the complex planning of underlay networks. See example for more details. Automatical ippool for applications needing static ip To realize static IP addresses, some open source projects need hardcode IP addresses in the application's annotation, which is prone to operations accidents, manual operations of IP address conflicts, higher IP management costs caused by application scalability. Spiderpool could automatically create, delete, scale up and down a dedicated ippool with static IP address just for one application, which could minimize operation efforts. For stateless applications, the IP address range can be automatically fixed and IP resources can be dynamically scaled according to the number of application replicas. See example for more details. For stateful applications, IP addresses can be automatically fixed for each POD, and the overall IP scaling range can be fixed as well. And IP resources can be dynamically scaled according to the number of application replicas. See example for more details. The dedicated ippool could have keep some redundant IP address, which supports application to performance a rolling update when creating new pods. See example for more details. Support for third-party application controllers. See example for details Manual ippool for applications needing static ip but the administrator expects specify IP address by hand. See example for details For applications not requiring static IP addresses, they can share an IP pool. See example for details For one application with pods running on nodes accessing different underlay subnet, spiderpool could assign IP addresses within different subnets. See example for details Multiple IP pools can be set for a pod for the usage of backup IP resources. See example for details Set global reserved IPs that will not be assigned to Pods, it can avoid to misuse IP address already used by other network hosts. See example for details when assigning multiple NICs to a pod with Multus CNI , spiderpool could specify different subnet for each NIC. See example for details IP pools can be shared by whole cluster or bound to a specified namespace. See example for details An additional plugin veth provided by spiderpool has features: help some CNI addons be able to access clusterIP and pod-healthy check , such as macvlan CNI , vlan CNI , ipvlan CNI , sriov CNI , ovs CNI .

network\" and \"underlay network\". Despite no strict definition for underlay and overlay networks in cloud-native networking, we can simply abstract their characteristics from many CNI projects. The two technologies meet the needs of different scenarios. The article provides a brief comparison of IPAM and network performance between the two technologies, which offers better insights into the unique features and use cases of Spiderpool. Why underlay network solutions? In data center scenarios, the following requirements necessitate underlay network solutions: Low-latency applications need optimized network latency and throughput provided by underlay networks Initial migration of traditional host applications to the cloud use traditional network methods such as service exposure and discovery and multi subnets Network management in the data center desires security controls such as firewalls and traditional network observation techniques to implement cluster network monitoring. Architecture Spiderpool consists of the following components: Spiderpool controller: a set of deployments that manage CRD validation, status updates, IP recovery, and automated IP pools Spiderpool agent: a set of daemonsets that help Spiderpool plugin by performing IP allocation and coordinator plugin for information synchronization. Spiderpool plugin: a binary plugin on each host that CNI can utilize to implement IP allocation. coordinator plugin: a binary plugin on each host that CNI can use for multi-NIC route coordination, IP conflict detection, and host connectivity. On top of its own components, Spiderpool relies on open-source underlay CNIs to allocate network interfaces to Pods. You can use Multus CNI to manage multiple NICs and CNI configurations. Any CNI project compatible with third-party IPAM plugins can work well with Spiderpool, such as: Macvlan CNI , vlan CNI , ipvlan CNI , SR-IOV CNI , ovs CNI , Multus CNI , Calico CNI , Weave CNI Use case: collaborate with one or more underlay CNIs In underlay networks, Spiderpool can work with underlay CNIs such as Macvlan CNI and SR-IOV CNI to provide the following benefits: Rich IPAM capabilities for underlay CNIs, including shared/fixed IPs, multi-NIC IP allocation, and dual-stack support One or more underlay NICs for Pods with coordinating routes between multiple NICs to ensure smooth communication with consistent request and reply data paths Enhanced connectivity between open-source underlay CNIs and hosts using additional veth network interfaces and route control. This enables clusterIP access, local health checks of applications, and much more How can you deploy containers using a single underlay CNI, when a cluster has multiple underlying setups? Some nodes in the cluster are virtual machines like VMware that don't enable promiscuous mode, while others are bare metal and connected to traditional switch networks. What CNI solution should be deployed on each type of node? Some bare metal nodes only have one SR-IOV high-speed NIC that provides 64 VFs. How can more pods run on such a node? Some bare metal nodes have an SR-IOV high-speed NIC capable of running low-latency applications, while others have only ordinary network cards for running regular applications. What CNI solution should be deployed on each type of node? By simultaneously deploying multiple underlay CNIs through Multus CNI configuration and Spiderpool's IPAM abilities, resources from various infrastructure nodes across the cluster can be integrated to solve these problems. For example, as shown in the above diagram, different nodes with varying networking capabilities in a cluster can use various underlay CNIs, such as SR-IOV CNI for nodes with SR-IOV network cards, Macvlan CNI for nodes with ordinary network cards, and ipvlan CNI for nodes with restricted network access (e.g., VMware virtual machines with limited layer 2 network forwarding). Use case: collaborate with overlay and underlay CNIs In overlay networks, Spiderpool uses Multus to add an overlay NIC (such as Calico or Cilium ) and multiple underlay NICs (such as Macvlan CNI or SR-IOV CNI) for each Pod. This offers several benefits: Rich IPAM features for underlay CNIs, including shared/fixed IPs, multi-NIC IP allocation, and dual-stack support. Route coordination for multiple underlay CNI NICs and an overlay NIC for Pods, ensuring the consistent request and reply data paths for smooth communication. Use the overlay NIC as the default one with route coordination and enable local host connectivity to enable clusterIP access, local health checks of applications, and forwarding overlay network traffic through overlay networks while forwarding underlay network traffic through underlay networks. The integration of Multus CNI and Spiderpool IPAM enables the collaboration of an overlay CNI and multiple underlay CNIs. For example, in clusters with nodes of varying network capabilities, Pods on bare-metal nodes can access both overlay and underlay NICs. Meanwhile, Pods on virtual machine nodes only serving east-west services are connected to the Overlay NIC. This approach provides several benefits: Applications providing east-west services can be restricted to being allocated only the overlay NIC while those providing north-south services can simultaneously access overlay and underlay NICs. This results in reduced Underlay IP resource usage, lower manual maintenance costs, and preserved pod connectivity within the cluster. Fully integrate resources from virtual machines and bare-metal nodes.","title":"Architecture"},{"location":"concepts/arch/#spiderpool-architecture","text":"","title":"Spiderpool architecture"},{"location":"concepts/arch/#comparison-of-underlay-and-overlay-network-scenarios","text":"There are two technologies in cloud-native networking: \"overlay network\" and \"underlay network\".

SpiderEndpoint garbage collection Once a pod is created and gets IPs from SpiderIPPool , Spiderpool will create a corresponding SpiderEndpoint object at the same time. It will take a finalizer (except the StatefulSet pod) and will be set to OwnerReference with the pod.

are two technologies in cloud-native networking: \"overlay network\" and \"underlay network\". Despite no strict definition for underlay and overlay networks in cloud-native networking, we can simply abstract their characteristics from many CNI projects. The two technologies meet the needs of different scenarios. Spiderpool is designed for underlay networks, and the following comparison of the two solutions can better illustrate the features and usage scenarios of Spiderpool. IPAM for overlay networks These solutions implement the decoupling of the Pod network and host network, such as Calico , Cilium and other CNI plugins. Typically, they use tunnel technology such as vxlan to build an overlay network plane, and use NAT technology for north-south traffic. These IPAM solutions have the following characteristics: Divide Pod subnets into node-based IP blocks In terms of a smaller subnet mask, the Pod subnet is divided into smaller IP blocks, and each node is assigned one or more IP blocks depending on the actual IP allocation account. First, since the IPAM plugin on each node only needs to allocate and release IP addresses in the local IP block, there is no IP allocation conflict with IPAM on other nodes, achieving more efficient allocation. Second, a specific IP address follows an IP block and is allocated within one node all the time, so it cannot be assigned on other nodes together with a bound Pod. Sufficient IP address resources Subnets not overlapping with any CIDR, could be used by the cluster, so the cluster has enough IP address resources as long as NAT technology is used in an appropriate manner. As a result, IPAM components face less pressure to reclaim abnormal IP addresses. No requirement for static IP addresses For the static IP address requirement, there is a difference between a stateless application and a stateful application. Regarding stateless application like deployment, the Pod's name will change when the Pod restarts, and the business logic of the application itself is stateless. Thus static IP addresses means that all the Pod replicas are fixed in a set of IP addresses; for stateful applications such as statefulset, considering both the fixed information including Pod's names and stateful business logic, the strong binding of one Pod and one specific IP address needs to be implemented for static IP addresses. The \"overlay network solution\" mostly exposes the ingress and source addresses of services to the outside of the cluster with the help of NAT technology, and realizes the east-west communication through DNS, clusterIP and other technologies. In addition, although the IP block of IPAM fixes the IP to one node, it does not guarantee the application replicas follow the scheduling. Therefore, there is no scope for the static IP address capability. Most of the mainstream CNIs in the community have not yet supported \"static IP addressed\", or support it in a rough way. The advantage of the \"overlay network solution\" is that the CNI plugins are highly compatible with any underlying network environment, and can provide independent subnets with sufficient IP addresses for Pods. These solutions share the node's network for Pods, which means Pods can directly obtain IP addresses in the node network. Thus, applications can directly use their own IP addresses for east-west and north-south communications. There are two typical scenarios for underlay network solutions: clusters deployed on a \"legacy network\" and clusters deployed on an IAAS environment, such as a public cloud. The following summarizes the IPAM characteristics of the \"legacy network scenario\": An IP address able to be assigned to any node As the number of network devices in the data center increases and multi-cluster technology evolves, IPv4 address resources become scarce, thus requiring IPAM to improve the efficiency of IP usage. As the Pod replicas of the applications requiring \"static IP addresses\" could be scheduled to any node in the cluster and drift between nodes, IP addresses might drift together. Therefore, an IP address should be able to be allocated to a Pod on any node. Different replicas within one application could obtain IP addresses across subnets Take as an example one node could access subnet 172.20.1.0/24 while another node just only access subnet 172.20.2.0/24. In this case, when the replicas within one application need to be deployed across subnets, IPAM is required to be able to assign subnet-matched IP addresses to the application on different nodes. Static IP addresses For some traditional applications, the source IPs or destination IPs need to be sensed in the microservice. And network admins are used to enabling fine-grained network security control via firewalls and other means. Therefore, in order to reduce the transformation chores after the applications move to the Kubernetes, applications need static IP addresses. Pods with Multiple NICs need IP addresses of different underlay subnets Since the Pod is connected to an underlay network, it has the need for multiple NICs to reach different underlay subnets. IP conflict Underlay networks are more prone to IP conflicts. For instance, Pods conflict with host IPs outside the cluster, or conflict with other clusters under the same subnet. But it is difficult for IPAM to discover these conflicting IP addresses externally unless CNI plugins are involved for real-time IP conflict detection. Release and recover IP addresses Because of the scarcity of IP addresses in underlay networks and the static IP address requirements of applications, a newly launched Pod may fail due to the lack of IP addresses owing to some IP addresses not being released by abnormal Pods. This requires IPAMs to have a more accurate, efficient and timely IP recovery mechanism. The advantages of the underlay network solution include: no need for network NAT mapping, which makes cloud-based network transformation for applications way more convenient; the underlying network firewall and other devices can achieve relatively fine control of Pod communication; no tunneling technology contributes to improved throughput and latency performance of network communications. Performance comparison between overlay CNIs and underlay CNIs Overlay CNIs rely on tunnel encapsulation and host forwarding to achieve Pod communication across nodes, while underlay CNIs can directly access the host network without tunneling overhead. This results in differences in network latency and throughput performance. To compare the performance of different CNI solutions, tests were conducted on a cluster with two bare-metal nodes equipped with 25G Mellanox CX5 NICs: Network interface performance between the two bare-metal nodes Cross-node Pod network performance based on Macvlan Cross-node Pod network performance based on SR-IOV Cross-node Pod network performance based on Calico(v3.23) vxlan Cross-node Pod network performance based on Cilium(v1.13) vxlan As shown in the above figure, the test results demonstrate that underlay CNIs like Macvlan and SR-IOV outperform overlay solutions.","title":"Underlay and overlay solutions"},{"location":"concepts/solution/#underlay-and-overlay-network-solutions","text":"There are two technologies in cloud-native networking: \"overlay network\" and \"underlay network\".

Thus static IP addresses means that all the Pod replicas are fixed in a set of IP addresses; for stateful applications such as statefulset, considering both the fixed information including Pod's names and stateful business logic, the strong binding of one Pod and one specific IP address needs to be implemented for static IP addresses. The \"overlay network solution\" mostly exposes the ingress and source addresses of services to the outside of the cluster with the help of NAT technology, and realizes the east-west communication through DNS, clusterIP and other technologies. In addition, although the IP block of IPAM fixes the IP to one node, it does not guarantee the application replicas follow the scheduling. Therefore, there is no scope for the static IP address capability. Most of the mainstream CNIs in the community have not yet supported \"static IP addressed\", or support it in a rough way. The advantage of the \"overlay network solution\" is that the CNI plugins are highly compatible with any underlying network environment, and can provide independent subnets with sufficient IP addresses for Pods. These solutions share the node's network for Pods, which means Pods can directly obtain IP addresses in the node network. Thus, applications can directly use their own IP addresses for east-west and north-south communications. There are two typical scenarios for underlay network solutions: clusters deployed on a \"legacy network\" and clusters deployed on an IAAS environment, such as a public cloud. The following summarizes the IPAM characteristics of the \"legacy network scenario\": An IP address able to be assigned to any node As the number of network devices in the data center increases and multi-cluster technology evolves, IPv4 address resources become scarce, thus requiring IPAM to improve the efficiency of IP usage. As the Pod replicas of the applications requiring \"static IP addresses\" could be scheduled to any node in the cluster and drift between nodes, IP addresses might drift together. Therefore, an IP address should be able to be allocated to a Pod on any node. Different replicas within one application could obtain IP addresses across subnets Take as an example one node could access subnet 172.20.1.0/24 while another node just only access subnet 172.20.2.0/24. In this case, when the replicas within one application need to be deployed across subnets, IPAM is required to be able to assign subnet-matched IP addresses to the application on different nodes. Static IP addresses For some traditional applications, the source IPs or destination IPs need to be sensed in the microservice. And network admins are used to enabling fine-grained network security control via firewalls and other means. Therefore, in order to reduce the transformation chores after the applications move to the Kubernetes, applications need static IP addresses. Pods with Multiple NICs need IP addresses of different underlay subnets Since the Pod is connected to an underlay network, it has the need for multiple NICs to reach different underlay subnets. IP conflict Underlay networks are more prone to IP conflicts. For instance, Pods conflict with host IPs outside the cluster, or conflict with other clusters under the same subnet. But it is difficult for IPAM to discover these conflicting IP addresses externally unless CNI plugins are involved for real-time IP conflict detection. Release and recover IP addresses Because of the scarcity of IP addresses in underlay networks and the static IP address requirements of applications, a newly launched Pod may fail due to the lack of IP addresses owing to some IP addresses not being released by abnormal Pods. This requires IPAMs to have a more accurate, efficient and timely IP recovery mechanism. The advantages of the underlay network solution include: no need for network NAT mapping, which makes cloud-based network transformation for applications way more convenient; the underlying network firewall and other devices can achieve relatively fine control of Pod communication; no tunneling technology contributes to improved throughput and latency performance of network communications.","title":"IPAM for overlay networks"},{"location":"concepts/solution/#performance-comparison-between-overlay-cnis-and-underlay-cnis","text":"Overlay CNIs rely on tunnel encapsulation and host forwarding to achieve Pod communication across nodes, while underlay CNIs can directly access the host network without tunneling overhead. This results in differences in network latency and throughput performance. To compare the performance of different CNI solutions, tests were conducted on a cluster with two bare-metal nodes equipped with 25G Mellanox CX5 NICs: Network interface performance between the two bare-metal nodes Cross-node Pod network performance based on Macvlan Cross-node Pod network performance based on SR-IOV Cross-node Pod network performance based on Calico(v3.23) vxlan Cross-node Pod network performance based on Cilium(v1.13) vxlan As shown in the above figure, the test results demonstrate that underlay CNIs like Macvlan and SR-IOV outperform overlay solutions.","title":"Performance comparison between overlay CNIs and underlay CNIs"},{"location":"concepts/spiderendpoint/","text":"SpiderEndpoint A SpiderEndpoint resource represents IP address allocation details for a specific endpoint object.

In this page, we'll introduce how to build a complete Underlay network environment in Calico + BGP mode, and integrate it with Spiderpool to enable fixed IP addresses for applications.

Performance Testing Spiderpool is a high-performance IPAM CNI plugin for underlay networks. This report will compare its performance with the mainstream underlay IPAM CNI plugins (such as Whereabouts , Kube-OVN ) and the widely used overlay IPAM CNI plugin calico-ipam under the \"1000 Pod\" scenario. Background Why do we need to do performance testing on the underlay IPAM CNI plugin? The speed at which IPAM allocates IP addresses largely determines the speed of application publishing. Underlay IPAM often becomes a performance bottleneck when a large-scale Kubernetes cluster recovers from failures. Under underlay networks, private IPv4 addresses are limited. Within a limited range of IP addresses, concurrent creation of Pods can involve IP address preemption and conflict, and it is challenging to quickly adjust the limited IP address resources.

Competition occurs when multiple Pods in a cluster allocate IP addresses from the same pool. Support hosting the entire lifecycle of an IP pool, synchronizing it with workload creation, scaling, deletion, and reducing concurrency or storage issues caused by overly large shared pools. macvlan v1.1.1 Whereabouts (CRD backend) v0.6.1 Each Node can define its own available IP pool ranges. If there are duplicate IP addresses defined between Nodes, these IP addresses are promoted as a shared resource. Kube-OVN (underlay) v1.11.3 Kube-OVN v1.11.3 IP addresses are organized by Subnet. Each Namespace can belong to a specific Subnet. Pods under the Namespace will automatically obtain IP addresses from the Subnet they belong to. Subnets are also a cluster resource, and the IP addresses of the same Subnet can be distributed on any Node. Calico v3.23.3 calico-ipam (CRD backend) v3.23.3 Each Node has one or more IP blocks exclusively, and the Pods on each Node only use the IP addresses in the local IP block. There is no competition or conflict between Nodes, and the allocation efficiency is very high. Plan During the testing, we will follow the following agreement: Testing under IPv4 stack and IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack. When testing the underlay IPAM CNI plugins, ensure that the number of available IP addresses is 1:1 to the number of Pods as much as possible. For example, if we plan to create 1000 Pods in the next step, we should limit the number of available IPv4/IPv6 addresses to 1000. Specifically, we will attempt to create a total of 1000 Pods on the Kubernetes cluster in the following two ways, and record the time taken for all Pods to become Running : Create only one Deployment with 1000 replicas. Create 100 Deployments with 10 replicas per Deployment. Then, we will use the following command to delete these 1000 Pods at once, and record the time it took for all Pods to become Running : kubectl get pod | grep \"prefix\" | awk '{print $1}' | xargs kubectl delete pod Next, power down all nodes and then power up, simulate fault recovery, and record the time it took for all Pods to become Running again.

To some extent, it is also a mechanism for reserving IP addresses, but its main function is not like this. Field excludeIPs is more of a syntax sugar , so that users can more flexibly define the IP address ranges of the IPPool. For example, create an IPPool without using excludeIPs , which contains two IP ranges: 172.18.41.40-172.18.41.44 and 172.18.41.46-172.18.41.50 , you should define the ips as follows: apiVersion : spiderpool.spidernet.io/v2beta1 kind : SpiderIPPool metadata : name : not-use-excludeips spec : subnet : 172.18.41.0/24 ips : - 172.18.41.40-172.18.41.44 - 172.18.41.46-172.18.41.50 But in fact, this semantics can be more succinctly described through excludeIPs : apiVersion : spiderpool.spidernet.io/v2beta1 kind : SpiderIPPool metadata : name : use-excludeips spec : subnet : 172.18.41.0/24 ips : - 172.18.41.40-172.18.41.50 excludeIPs : - 172.18.41.45 Field excludeIPs will make sure that any Pod that allocates IP addresses from this IPPool will not use these excluded IP addresses. However, it should be noted that this mechanism only has an effect on the IPPool itself with excludeIPs defined. Use SpiderReservedIP Unlike configuring field excluedIPs in SpiderIPPool CR, creating a SpiderReservedIP CR is really a way to define the global reserved IP address rules of a Kubernetes cluster. The IP addresses defined in ReservedIP cannot be used by any Pod in the cluster, regardless of whether some IPPools have inadvertently defined them. More details refer to definition of SpiderReservedIP . Set up Spiderpool If you have not deployed Spiderpool yet, follow the guide installation for instructions on how to deploy and easily configure Spiderpool.

Of course, we dare not stop this running Pod and recycle its IP addresses, but ReservedIP will still ensure that when the Pod is terminated, no other Pods can continue to use the reserved IP address.

Please consult the segments from your current release until now before upgrading your spiderpool. Upgrade to 0.3.6 from (<=0.3.5) Description There's a design flaw for SpiderSubnet feature in auto-created IPPool label. The previous label ipam.spidernet.io/owner-application corresponding value uses '-' as separative sign. For example, we have deployment ns398-174835790/deploy398-82311862 and the corresponding label value is Deployment-ns398-174835790-deploy398-82311862 . It's very hard to unpack it to trace back what the application namespace and name is. Now, we use '_' rather than '-' as slash for SpiderSubnet feature label ipam.spidernet.io/owner-application , and the upper case will be like Deployment_ns398-174835790_deploy398-82311862 . Reference PR: #1162 In order to support multiple interfaces with SpiderSubnet feature, we also add one more label for auto-created IPPool.

assigning static IP addresses in underlay networks. In this page, we'll demonstrate how to build a complete underlay network solution using Multus , Macvlan , Veth , and Spiderpool , which meets the following kinds of requirements: Applications can be assigned static Underlay IP addresses through simple operations. Pods with multiple Underlay NICs connect to multiple Underlay subnets. Pods can communicate in various ways, such as Pod IP, clusterIP, and nodePort. Prerequisites Make sure a Kubernetes cluster is ready. Helm has been already installed. Install Macvlan Macvlan is a CNI plugin that allows pods to be assigned Macvlan virtual NICs for connecting to Underlay networks. Some Kubernetes installers include the Macvlan binary file by default that can be found at \"/opt/cni/bin/macvlan\" on your nodes. If the binary file is missing, you can download and install it on all nodes using the following command: wget https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/releases/download/v1.2.0/cni-plugins-linux-amd64-v1.2.0.tgz tar xvfzp ./cni-plugins-linux-amd64-v1.2.0.tgz -C /opt/cni/bin chmod +x /opt/cni/bin/macvlan Install Veth Veth is a CNI plugin designed to resolve the following issues in other CNIs like Macvlan and SR-IOV: Enable clusterIP communication for Pods in Macvlan CNI environments Facilitate connection between Pods and the host during health checks where Pods' Macvlan IPs are unable to communicate with the host Address communication issues in multiple NICs for Pods by automatically coordinating policy routing between NICs Download and install the Veth binary on all nodes: wget https://github.com/spidernet-io/plugins/releases/download/v0.1.4/spider-plugins-linux-amd64-v0.1.4.tar tar xvfzp ./spider-plugins-linux-amd64-v0.1.4.tar -C /opt/cni/bin chmod +x /opt/cni/bin/veth Install Multus Multus is a CNI plugin that allows Pods to have multiple NICs by scheduling third-party CNIs. The management of the Macvlan CNI configuration is simplified through the CRD-based approach provided by Multus, with nothing for manual editing of CNI configuration files on each host. Install Multus via the manifest: kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/multus-cni/v3.9/deployments/multus-daemonset.yml Confirm the operational status of Multus: ~# kubectl get pods -A | grep -i multus kube-system kube-multus-ds-hfzpl 1 /1 Running 0 5m kube-system kube-multus-ds-qm8j7 1 /1 Running 0 5m Verify the existence of the Multus configuration files ls /etc/cni/net.d/00-multus.conf on the node. Create a NetworkAttachmentDefinition for Macvlan. The following parameters need to be confirmed: Verify the required host parent interface for Macvlan. In this case, a Macvlan sub-interface will be created for Pods from the host parent interface --eth0. To implement clusterIP communication using Veth, confirm the service CIDR of the cluster through a query command kubectl -n kube-system get configmap kubeadm-config -oyaml | grep service or other methods. The following is the configuration for creating a NetworkAttachmentDefinition: MACLVAN_MASTER_INTERFACE = \"eth0\" SERVICE_CIDR = \"10.96.0.0/16\" cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f - apiVersion: k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1 kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition metadata: name: macvlan-conf namespace: kube-system spec: config: |- { \"cniVersion\": \"0.3.1\", \"name\": \"macvlan-conf\", \"plugins\": [ { \"type\": \"macvlan\", \"master\": \"${MACLVAN_MASTER_INTERFACE}\", \"mode\": \"bridge\", \"ipam\": { \"type\": \"spiderpool\" } },{ \"type\": \"veth\", \"service_cidr\": [\"${SERVICE_CIDR}\"] } ] } EOF Install Spiderpool Install Spiderpool. helm repo add spiderpool https://spidernet-io.github.io/spiderpool helm repo update spiderpool helm install spiderpool spiderpool/spiderpool --namespace kube-system If you are mainland user who is not available to access ghcr.io\uff0cYou can specify the parameter -set global.imageRegistryOverride=ghcr.m.daocloud.io to avoid image pulling failures for Spiderpool.

Start English | \u7b80\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587 Spiderpool can be used as a solution to provide fixed IPs in an Underlay network scenario, and this article will use Multus , Ovs-cni , and Spiderpool as examples to build a complete Underlay network solution that exposes the available bridges as node resources for use by the cluster. Prerequisites Make sure a multi-node Kubernetes cluster is ready. Helm has been already installed. Open vSwitch must be installed and running on the host. It could refer to Installation . The following examples are based on Ubuntu 22.04.1. installation may vary depending on the host system. ~# sudo apt-get install -y openvswitch-switch ~# sudo systemctl start openvswitch-switch Install Ovs-cni ovs-cni is a Kubernetes CNI plugin based on Open vSwitch (OVS) that provides a way to use OVS for network virtualization in a Kubernetes cluster in a Kubernetes cluster. Verify that the binary /opt/cni/bin/ovs exists on the node. if the binary is missing, you can download it and install it on all nodes using the following command: ~# wget https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/ovs-cni/releases/download/v0.31.1/plugin ~# mv ./plugin /opt/cni/bin/ovs ~# chmod +x /opt/cni/bin/ovs Note: Ovs-cni does not configure bridges, it is up to the user to create them and connect them to L2, L3, The following is an example of creating a bridge, to be executed on each node: Create an Open vSwitch bridge. ~# ovs-vsctl add-br br1 Network interface connected to the bridge\uff1a This procedure depends on your platform, the following commands are only example instructions and it may break your system. First use ip link show to query the host for available interfaces, the example uses the interface on the host: eth0 as an example. ~# ovs-vsctl add-port br1 eth0 ~# ip addr add <IP\u5730\u5740>/<\u5b50\u7f51\u63a9\u7801> dev br1 ~# ip link set br1 up ~# ip route add default via <\u9ed8\u8ba4\u7f51\u5173IP> dev br1 Once created, the following bridge information can be viewed on each node: ~# ovs-vsctl show ec16d9e1-6187-4b21-9c2f-8b6cb75434b9 Bridge br1 Port eth0 Interface eth0 Port br1 Interface br1 type: internal Port veth97fb4795 Interface veth97fb4795 ovs_version: \"2.17.3\" Install Multus Multus is a CNI plugin that allows Pods to have multiple NICs by scheduling third-party CNIs. The management of the ovs-cni CNI configuration is simplified through the CRD-based approach provided by Multus, with nothing for manual editing of CNI configuration files on each host. Install Multus via the manifest: kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/multus-cni/v3.9/deployments/multus-daemonset.yml Create a NetworkAttachmentDefinition for ovs-cni. The following parameters need to be confirmed: Confirm the required host bridge for ovs-cni, for example based on the command ovs-vsctl show , this example takes the host bridge: br1 as an example. cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f - apiVersion: k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1 kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition metadata: name: ovs-conf namespace: kube-system spec: config: |- { \"cniVersion\": \"0.3.1\", \"name\": \"ovs-conf\", \"plugins\": [ { \"type\": \"ovs\", \"bridge\": \"br1\", \"ipam\": { \"type\": \"spiderpool\" } } ] } EOF Install Spiderpool Install Spiderpool helm repo add spiderpool https://spidernet-io.github.io/spiderpool helm repo update spiderpool helm install spiderpool spiderpool/spiderpool --namespace kube-system If you are mainland user who is not available to access ghcr.io\uff0cYou can specify the parameter -set global.imageRegistryOverride=ghcr.m.daocloud.io to avoid image pulling failures for Spiderpool.
